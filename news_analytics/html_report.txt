      <td>\nWestern sanctions have disrupted nearly every part of Russia's financial system, but there is one big\nexception.\n\nThe domestic-payments system continued to work smoothly after Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. pulled\nout earlier this month. While the card giants' exit from Russia was viewed as a significant move by\nmany in the West, the reality on the ground was anything but. Most Russian consumers never lost the\nability to use their Mastercard- and Visa-branded cards to pay for things within the country.\n</td>
      <td>\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nHow effective will sanctions be in putting pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the war? Please join the\nconversation below.\n\nThere were roughly 197 million Mastercard or Visa cards in Russia at the end of 2020, according to the\nNilson Report, a trade publication. But behind the scenes, the cards don't rely on the U.S. networks'\nsystems to process payments in Russia. For years, they have used a homegrown system overseen by\nRussia's central bank.\n\nThe National Payment Card System—known by its Russian initials NSPK—runs the financial plumbing\nthat underpins card transactions in Russia, even for cards bearing Visa and Mastercard logos.\n\nThe system was part of Moscow's eight-year effort to insulate the Russian economy from Western\nfinancial pressure. The Kremlin also has aggressively promoted Russia's own card company, called\nMir, which is built on NSPK's infrastructure. More than 100 million Mir cards have been issued since its\nlaunch in 2015, according to Mir's website.\n\nThe resilience of Russia's payments system is a rare win for President Vladimir Putin in his financial\nwar with the West. Russia failed to break its dependence on Western imports, leaving the country in\ndire need of key parts for manufacturing. Before the war, Russia amassed $630 billion in reserves to\nensure it could protect the ruble, but that effort was undermined when the U.S. and European\nUnionfroze Russian central-bank assets.\n\n"We provided for our national security in the payments space," said Alma Obayeva, head of the\nNational Payments Council, a Russian trade association.\n\n\n\n\nThe retreat of Visa and Mastercard did have one big consequence for Russians: In many cases, their\ncards now don't work outside the country. The Mir network extends only to a small number of countries\nbesides Russia, most of which are former Soviet republics. Russian officials have been in talks in\nrecent days to expand it to Venezuela and Iran, according to reports from the TASS state news agency.\nSome Russian banks have said they are exploring partnerships with China's UnionPay to issue cards\nthat their customers can use more widely.\n\nStill, Russians' inability to use their cards to withdraw cash or make purchases abroad is aligned with\nthe Kremlin's goal to keep assets in the country. Some Russians who have fled have said Visa and\nMastercard's cutoff played into Mr. Putin's hands.\n\nOn a February call to discuss potential Russia sanctions, executives from Visa, Mastercard and other\npayments companies told Treasury Department officials that banning U.S. networks from handling\nRussian bank transactions wouldn't be especially painful, according to people familiar with the matter.\nSanctions, they said, would simply push more transactions onto Mir.\n\nRepresentatives for Visa and Mastercard declined to comment.\n\nMore countries have developed their own payments infrastructure, limiting the clout of Visa and\nMastercard and, by extension, the ability of the U.S. to influence countries' behavior through sanctions\nthat target their banking systems. China's state-owned UnionPay handles most domestic transactions\non cards issued by Chinese banks. Turkey and India started their own networks in recent years to\nwean the countries' banks off Visa and Mastercard.\n\nRussia tried to reduce its vulnerability to Western financial pressure after it was stung by sanctions over\nits 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nVisa and Mastercard at the time accounted for nearly all card network activity in Russia. Their networks\nserve as a link between merchants and banks that issue debit and credit cards, and they handle the\nrouting of card transactions.\n\nIn March 2014, hundreds of thousands of Russians discovered that their cards had been rendered\nuseless overnight. U.S. sanctions over Crimea had prompted Visa and Mastercard to block services to\nseveral banks linked to associates of Mr. Putin.\n\nFor Russian officials, the move highlighted a vulnerability. Within months, Mr. Putin signed a law\nestablishing NSPK. A later amendment to the law effectively forced Visa and Mastercard to transfer\nprocessing of transactions to NSPK. The two U.S. companies at first opposed the law and suggested\nthey might leave Russia. But by early 2015, both had agreed to use NSPK's system.\n\nLater that year, NSPK launched Mir. The name means both "world" and "peace" in Russian. It was\nchosen after an internet naming contest, in which some of the rejected alternatives were "Kometa"\n(Comet) and "Patriot."\n\nInitially, Russians saw little reason to swap their Visa- and Mastercard-branded cards for Mir cards.\nThen the Kremlin put its thumb on the scales.\n\nIn 2017, Russia passed a law requiring banks that handle pensioners' payments and salaries of\npublic-sector employees such as teachers and military personnel to make those funds available\nthrough Mir cards. Mir usage surged, with card issuance rising to 95 million by the end of 2020 from\nabout 2 million in 2016, according to NSPK. The law also mandated that Mir be accepted at\npoint-of-sale terminals used by many merchants.\n\nNSPK invested heavily in marketing Mir, sponsoring the Russian national soccer team and promoting\nincentives such as cashback programs.\n\nBy taking over payment processing, NSPK became a moneymaker for Russia's central bank, collecting\nfee revenue that otherwise would have flowed to Visa and Mastercard. In 2020, the payments system\nearned 8.2 billion rubles in net profit, or about $94 million at current exchange rates, according to its\nannual report.\n\nIssuance of Mir cards has boomed in recent weeks after the exit of the foreign card giants. Russian\nlender Rosbank has reported that demand for debit cards that run on Mir's network more than doubled\nbetween January and March from the same period last year.\n\n"There is simply a huge, frenzied demand for Mir cards," Ms. Obayeva said. "There is a long queue."\n\n\n\n\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@wsj.com and AnnaMaria Andriotis at\nannamaria.andriotis@wsj.com\n\nRussia Built Parallel Payments System That Escaped Western Sanctions\n</td>

      <td>\nWeeks before thermobaric rockets rained down on Ukraine, the chattering classes at the World\nEconomic Forumdeclared "climate action failure" the biggest global risk for the coming decade. On the\neve of war, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry fretted about the "massive emissions consequences" of\nRussian invasion and worried that the world might forget about the risks of climate change if fighting\nbroke out. Amid the conflict and the many other challenges facing the globe right now, like inflation and\nfood price hikes, the global elite has an unhealthy obsession with climate change.\n</td>
      <td>\nThis fixation has had three important consequences. First, it has distracted the Western world from real\ngeopolitical threats. Russia's invasion should be a wake-up call that war is still a serious danger that\nrequires democratic nations' attention. But a month into the war in Ukraine, United Nations\nSecretary-General António Guterres—whose organization's main purpose is ensuring world\npeace—was focused instead on "climate catastrophe," warning that fossil-fuel addiction will bring\n"mutually assured destruction." His comments come at a time when nuclear weapons are posing the\nbiggest risk of literal mutually assured destruction in half a century.\n\nSecond, the narrow focus on immediate climate objectives undermines future prosperity. The world\ncurrently shells out more than half a trillion dollars annually in private and public funds on climate\npolicies, while spending from the governments of countries in the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development on innovation that underpins growth in areas such as healthcare, space,\ndefense, agriculture and science has been declining as a percentage of gross domestic product over\nrecent decades.\n\nEducation performance in developed nations is stagnant or declining, and real income growth among\nOECD countries has almost stalled this century. By contrast, in China, where innovation-related\nspending is up 50% from where it was in 2000 and education is rapidly improving, average incomes\nhave increased fivefold since the start of the 21st century.\n\nThird, in the world's poorest countries, the international community's focus on putting up solar panels\ncoexists with a woeful underinvestment in solutions to massive existing problems. Infectious diseases\nlike tuberculosis and malaria kill millions; malnutrition afflicts almost a billion people; more than three\nbillion lack access to reliable energy.\n\nThese and other issues plaguing the developing world are solvable, but get far less funding from\nwealthy countries than climate change. Giving the developing world affordable access to consistently\navailable energy—which often requires fossil fuels—is the key to lifting most of the world out of poverty.\nYet before the invasion of Ukraine, the developed world was racing to make fossil fuel energy more\nexpensive and less accessible for the world's poorest.\n\nWhat underpins this climate fixation? The false and irresponsible idea that global warming poses an\nimmediate existential risk for the world. Climate change is real and man-made; have no doubt about\nthat. But the best economic estimates used by the Obama and Biden administrations, as well as those\ncreated by the only climate economist to ever win the Nobel Prize in economics, all show that the total\n\nimpact of unmitigated climate change—not just on the economy but overall—would be equivalent to\nless than a 4% hit to global GDP annually by the end of the century.\n\nThe U.N. estimates that the average person in 2100 will be 450% as rich as today. If climate change\ncontinues unabated, the average person will be "only" 434% as rich—a far from catastrophic outcome.\n\nA world scared witless doesn't make smart decisions—so it should be no surprise it hasn't managed to\nmake a dent in climate change. Globally, last year saw the most CO2 emissions ever, despite $5 trillion\nspent over the past decade on climate policies. The U.N. admitted in 2019 that there has been "no real\nchange in the global emissions pathway in the last decade" despite the global Paris agreement.\n\nThe European Union has tried to shift to renewables but still gets more than 70% of its energy from\nfossil fuels. Much of the rest is generated by burning wood chips from trees chopped down in America\nand transported on diesel ships. Solar and wind produce only 3% of the European Union's energy, and\nthe technology is unreliable, often requiring backup from gas when the sun doesn't shine or the wind\ndoesn't blow. Europe's refusal to embrace shale gas—which can be found throughout the Continent but\nremains untapped—has left it at the mercy of Russian gas. The past two months show how dangerous\nthis is.\n\nWell-meaning politicians across the world have been proposing policies to reach net-zero emissions in\ncoming decades. According to McKinsey, the policies will cost $9.2 trillion every year until net zero is\nsupposed to be achieved in 2050. This is equivalent to half the global tax take. Such extremely costly\npolicies are unlikely to be enacted by emerging economies such as India or Africa, whose emissions will\nskyrocket as their populations and economies grow. Net zero is also likely to fail in the developed world,\nwhere its high costs will erode prosperity and thus political support. Achieving net zero would cost every\nAmerican family $19,300 a year, according to the McKinsey study.\n\nTo respond to climate change effectively, the world needs to spend more on green-energy innovation\nand develop renewables that are reliable and cost-effective. To address their immediate energy\nproblems, Europe and America need to embrace fracking—despite Russian-funded propaganda\ndiscrediting it—and help the rest of the world access the oil and gas it needs. There are many serious\nthreats in the world today, but most won't get the attention they deserve until the political classes drop\ntheir hyperbole about climate change and treat it like what it actually is—only one of the many problems\nto be solved in the 21st century.\n\nMr. Lomborg is president of the Copenhagen Consensus and a visiting fellow at Stanford University's\nHoover Institution. His latest book is "False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts\nthe Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet."\n\nBe Afraid of Nuclear War, Not Climate Change\n</td>

      <td>\nPerhaps desperate for a win after their failures in Afghanistan, senior Pentagon officials are\nbragging to the Washington Post about the success of "integrated deterrence" in Ukraine. This\nbuzzy new phrase serves as the intellectual foundation of President Biden's forthcoming National\nDefense Strategy, combining diplomacy, alliances and new technology with conventional hard\npower to deter bad guys from doing bad things.\n\nThat may sound reasonable, but the administration's embrace of integrated deterrence is an\nabandonment of the Pentagon's previous strategy of deterrence by denial. That required the U.S.\nto maintain enough military strength to turn back an adversary's aggression, particularly in Taiwan\nand Eastern Europe. In April 2021, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin justified the new approach\nunder the premise that allies and "galloping advances in technology" can pick up the slack.\n\nInnovative technologies and allied cooperation are important, but deterrence ultimately rests on an\nadversary's assessment of existing U.S. military power and Washington's willingness to employ it.\nThat's why integrated deterrence failed its first big test in Ukraine, where the Biden administration\nrelied on the threat of nonmilitary punishment to deter Vladimir Putin. The administration delayed\nlethal assistance to Kyiv for months and repeatedly signaled that military force was off the table\nfor fear of provoking Mr. Putin. Instead, the White House threatened to punish Mr. Putin with\nsanctions and diplomatic isolation if he invaded. Even though the Ukrainians have since inspired\nthe world through their courage and the Russians have shocked the world with their\nincompetence, integrated deterrence didn't work.\n\nNevertheless, anonymous Pentagon officials are spiking the football and moving the goal posts,\narguing that integrated deterrence is working because Mr. Putin hasn't expanded his war into\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization territory. This is a low bar for geopolitical success and ignores\nthe obvious reality that a NATO-Russia war is more, not less, likely since the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMoreover, the war isn't over, and while certain Pentagon officials are celebrating, others in the\nBiden administration are warning of Russian cyberattacks on U.S. domestic infrastructure. Many\n\nare concerned that Mr. Putin could use tactical nuclear weapons. The confidently anonymous\nPentagon officials are crowing "that the model of integrated deterrence comes out smelling pretty\ngood from this" should go to Kyiv or Mariupol, take in the smell, and spend some time looking at\nthe bombed-out city blocks and bodies lying in the street. If this is the success of integrated\ndeterrence, what would failure look like?\n\nNot content to confine their hubris to Eastern Europe, anonymous Pentagon officials are also\nsuggesting that integrated deterrence is working in the Western Pacific, where Xi Jinping may be\nrethinking a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. If Ukraine turns out to be Mr. Putin's graveyard, perhaps\nMr. Xi will abandon his ambitions. But there is little evidence to support this wishful thinking,\nespecially since China may yet provide Russia with military assistance in Ukraine. It is also\npossible Mr. Xi senses an opportunity and will decide to expedite his timeline for Taiwan,\nespecially since Mr. Biden has consistently signaled a desire to avoid direct military confrontation\nwith a nuclear-armed adversary.\n\nDefending Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion would require the U.S. to engage directly a\nnuclear-armed state. Deterring such an invasion in the first place, which the destruction on display\nin Ukraine reminds us is a far preferable outcome, will require America to integrate more\nconventional hard power into deterrence as quickly as possible. Sanctions, diplomacy and\npromising but unproven technologies can't substitute for hard power. Nor will they substitute for\narming Taiwan to the teeth with asymmetric capabilities before Mr. Xi launches an invasion.\n\nThe Pentagon, while taking an anonymous victory lap, appears to be moving in the opposite\ndirection. Its new defense budget fails to keep pace with inflation. Rather than growing the Navy,\nthe budget proposes to purchase four fewer ships than the 13 that Congress funded in the current\nfiscal year. It also includes no plan to arm Taiwan to deny a Chinese invasion. This lack of\nurgency confirms that the Biden administration is using the academic jargon of "integrated\ndeterrence" to justify cuts to conventional hard power and avoid the hard work of fielding\ncombat-credible forces capable of denying our enemies their objectives.\n\nIt isn't hard to understand why. The administration is cutting corners on defense because of\npressure from progressives who view it as a distraction from their domestic spending agenda.\nEven after the dismemberment of Ukraine, a $2 trillion Covid stimulus bill and a $1 trillion\nso-called infrastructure bill, Democrats are still talking about building back better. They've gone so\nfar as to project these preferences onto Mr. Putin. "The Russian people don't need another foreign\nadventure," an anonymous senior administration official said, rebuking the Russian dictator. "What\nthey need is better health care, build back better, roads, schools, economic opportunity."\n\nUnfortunately, integrated deterrence didn't sway Mr. Putin. It failed, at great cost to the Ukrainian\npeople and at great risk to the world. That is nothing to brag about, even anonymously.\n\nMr. Gallagher, a Republican, represents Wisconsin's Eighth Congressional District and is a\nmember of the House Armed Services and Intelligence committees.\n\nBiden's 'Integrated Deterrence' Fails in Ukraine\n</td>

      <td>\nThe journalist Michael Kinsley famously proposed that "a gaffe is when a politician tells the truth—some\nobvious truth he isn't supposed to say." By this standard, the ad libbed final sentence of President\nBiden's Warsaw speech may be a gaffe for the ages. Administration officials scurried to walk back the\nsuggestion that regime change in Russia was among the objectives of U.S. assistance to Ukraine.\nAmerica's NATO ambassador, Julianne Smith, suggested (plausibly enough) that Mr. Biden's words\nrepresented "a principled human reaction" to his encounter earlier in the day with hundreds of\ndesperate Ukrainian refugees.\n\nMr. Biden's impromptu remark, which dominated coverage of an otherwise strong speech, raises a\nlarger question: Is it conceivable that the rest of the world can return to business as usual with Vladimir\nPutin as Russia's president, or must he and his country be treated as international pariahs so long as\nhe remains in power?\n</td>
      <td>\nMuch depends on how the war ends. It is now clear that Mr. Putin cannot achieve his initial objective:\nswiftly overthrowing Volodymyr Zelensky's government and installing a compliant regime in Kyiv.\nAlthough it is too early to know for sure, recent statements by Russian officials suggest that Mr. Putin is\npivoting to Plan B—securing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as well as the coastal land bridge to\nCrimea. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of intelligence for Ukraine's Defense Ministry, agrees with this\nassessment.\n\nIt is conceivable but unlikely that if the West expands the scope and accelerates the pace of arms\ndeliveries, Ukraine's forces could completely expel Russian invaders from their land. At this point,\nhowever, the most likely outcome is that both sides fall short of total victory and that a stalemate sets in,\nwith Ukraine governing the west and Russian forces occupying the east. This would create what Gen.\nBudanov calls "North and South Korea in Ukraine." Then what?\n\nOne possibility is that a version of the pre-invasion status quo might resume, with Russian and\nRussian-backed forces occupying much more Ukrainian territory than before the invasion. Fighting\nwould probably continue at a lower intensity along the new informal line of demarcation between the\ncontending forces.\n\nSanctions would continue, as would arms shipments to Ukraine and Europe's effort to decouple from\nRussian energy. The U.S. and its allies would intensify their efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically.\n\nThere is a somewhat more optimistic scenario in which the negotiations hosted by Turkey between\nRussia and Ukraine continue to progress and the intensity of the fighting gradually subsides. Even so,\nthe most Mr. Zelensky could offer without sparking domestic opposition would fall far short of the least\nMr. Putin could accept without jeopardizing his survival as Russia's leader. This matters because any\ndraft agreement would be subject to approval by popular referendum in Ukraine.\n\nBefore the most recent Russian invasion, Ukraine refused to accept Russia's annexation of Crimea,\nand it is less likely to do so after so much bloodshed and destruction at the hands of Russian forces. In\n\na similar vein, if Ukraine did not accept the territorial gains that Russian forces achieved in the Donbas\nin 2014, why would it accept the larger gains Russia has made this year? Ukraine seems willing to\nabandon its long-held aspiration to join NATO and discuss some form of neutrality, but only in return for\nsecurity guarantees from a Western coalition of the willing that Russia would find no more palatable.\n\nThe most likely outcome, I believe, is an armistice along the lines of the agreement that ended the\nshooting phase of the Korean War, leaving the large issues unresolved. Mr. Zelensky would tell his\npeople that he had refused to cede an inch of Ukrainian territory, while Mr. Putin would say that he had\nachieved his principal objective—protecting the Ukrainians who identify with Russia linguistically and\nculturally from an oppressive "Nazi" government.\n\nI do not see how the U.S. and its allies can resume normal relations with Russia while Vladimir Putin's\narmy enforces a de facto partition of Ukraine. Mr. Putin cannot be rewarded for naked aggression.\n\nIt is possible that over time Western sanctions will interact with the costs of occupation (including a\nguerrilla war against the invaders) to force Russia to withdraw, as the Soviets did from Afghanistan. But\nhaving paid such a heavy price for his invasion, Mr. Putin will not readily reverse it. Besides, a reversal\nwould violate the pan-Russian ideology that—as much as any cost-benefit calculation—shapes his\nstance toward Ukraine.\n\nIn the meantime, there would be a frozen conflict—and a ticking time bomb—in the heart of Europe.\n\nCould the kind of creative statesmanship that peacefully ended the Cold War succeed in these\ncircumstances? Then, the West was dealing with Mikhail Gorbachev, with whom (as Margaret Thatcher\nfamously opined) the West could do business. Now it would have to shake a bloody hand.\n\nThe Hard Truth in Biden's Gaffe\n</td>

      <td>\nSlowing economic activity in Europe related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine is likely to hurt online ad\nspending, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak asserted in a new research note.\n\n"The macro winds of uncertainty–in particular around Europe and Russia–continue to swirl," writes\nNowak, who trimmed his 2022 revenue estimates for online advertising players by between 1% and 2%.\n"We remain on macro data point watch for any signs of further weakening in Europe or the U.S."\n</td>
      <td>\nAs part of the call, Nowak tweaked his price targets on four stocks. For Twitter (ticker: TWTR) he keeps\nhis Equal Weight rating, and trims his target by $1 to $58. For Overweight-rated Snap (SNAP), he\nlikewise snips his target by a buck, to $58, while for Nextdoor Holdings (KIND), still Equal Weight-rated,\nhis target drops to $6.50, from $7. For Criteo (CRTO), a digital advertising platform, he maintains his\nEqual Weight rating, while cutting his target to $57, from $60.\n\nNowak notes that several companies at a recent Morgan Stanley tech conference spoke of potential or\nactual weakness in Europe.\n\n"Part of this may be due to some branded advertisers pausing spend to avoid advertising next to\nnegative content, while part of this may also be driven by some incremental weakness from the\nEuropean consumer," he writes. Nowak notes that European contribution to Internet ad platform sales\nrange from 8% for Pinterest (PINS) to 34% for Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (FB), with Russia alone\nabout 1%-2% of the total. He notes that many companies have pulled back or shut down advertising in\nRussia.\n\nNowak adds that for now he is leaving his 2023 estimates in place–and that the new forecast doesn't\nfactor in any further weakening of the U.S. consumer or ad markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Nowak repeats his Overweight ratings on Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta and Snap.\n\nFor Alphabet, he sees "outsize" ad revenue and free cash flow growth, driven by improved results in\ntravel and autos, among other categories.\n\nFor Meta, he thinks the headwinds from the company's investment in the TokTok competitor Reels will\neventually become a tailwind. We acknowledge it may be a couple of quarters for the company to\ndeliver revenue acceleration and Reels monetization that can instill confidence in the long-term cash\nflow potential but [we] remain bullish from a 12-month perspective," he writes.\n\nAnd for Snap, he says that the company has a smaller measurement gap to close relative to Facebook\non responding to Apple's ad targeting changes, and he expects improve ad efficacy, targeting and\nmeasurement to boost ad spend per advertiser and ad unit pricing. He thinks the company is "closer\nthan appreciated" to returning to 50%-plus growth rates.\n\nWrite to Eric J.

      <td>\nAbout the author: Andrei Kolesnikov is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International\nPeace. He is author of several books, including a biography of Anatoly Chubais.\n\nEver since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, sending the ruble plummeting and prompting a mass\nexodus of shocked middle-class residents of the big cities, the sight of Russians lining up to empty ATMs\nhas become a familiar one. On March 23, according to the newspaper Kommersant, the man spotted\ndoing just that in Istanbul was Anatoly Chubais, a special envoy to Russian President Vladimir Putin for\nrelations with international organizations on the energy transition, and the architect of Russia's\nprivatization in the 1990s.\n</td>
      <td>\nThis once influential deputy prime minister for economic and financial policy, the man who secured Boris\nYeltsin's victory in the 1996 presidential election and went on to reform the electric power sector and then\nfound Russia's nanotechnology industry, has apparently become a political refugee like so many other\nRussians right now. If the reports of his departure are true, he has joined the ranks of those who have\nfled Russia because they feel life there is intolerable while their country is waging war on neighboring\nUkraine. That their country has not only destroyed its own future with its "special military operation," but\nalso lost part of its past: several decades of contradictory efforts to build a new Russia. Anatoly Chubais,\na pragmatic romantic—or romantic pragmatist—who built a market economy in a land without any market\ntraditions, was directly linked to that past.\n\nHe also played a direct role in Vladimir Putin's political career, though he likely gave it little thought at the\ntime. In 1996, Putin's boss Anatoly Sobchak, the first democratically elected mayor of St. Petersburg\nfollowing the Soviet collapse, failed to be re-elected. His colleagues asked Chubais, back then also at the\nstart of his career as an official in the municipal administration of Leningrad, as St. Petersburg was\nknown, to help find a new position for Putin.\n\nChubais knew Putin in passing from the work at the St. Petersburg mayor's office. Such requests were\ncommonplace, and Chubais, as head of President Boris Yeltsin's administration, got Putin a minor\nposition within the Kremlin apparatus. Putin, a precise and diligent bureaucrat, soared quickly to dizzying\nheights, and by 1998 he was head of the FSB, the secret police, the organization in which he had begun\nhis career (and which, perhaps, he had never left), taking up a position of which he could once only have\ndreamed.\n\nIn August 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly fired his prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, and replaced him with\nPutin. By then, Chubais had left the government to work on reforming the electrical energy sector, but he\nretained enormous informal influence, and had direct access to the president. He met with Yeltsin\nspecifically to torpedo Putin's appointment. Chubais did not consider Putin a worthy heir to the first leader\nof post-Soviet Russia. But this was one of the rare occasions on which Yeltsin did not listen to Chubais.\n\nChubais, ever politically practical, went on to support Putin in his political career, despite the warnings of\nmany of his associates. At that time, the liberals assumed they would have complete control over Putin\nas the new presidential candidate, who had become popular as a result of his tough actions in Russia's\nbreakaway republic of Chechnya.\n\n\nThe relationship between Chubais and Putin was full of contradictions. The future Russian dictator was\nbarely able to forgive Chubais's opposition to his appointment as Yeltsin's successor, but at the same\ntime, he knew full well that it was Chubais who had set in motion—however indifferently—his rise to the\ntop. In addition, Putin and Chubais shared a close mutual friend from their time at the St. Petersburg\nmayor's office: Alexei Kudrin. He later became a respected finance minister and the informal leader of\nRussia's liberals. Thanks to this friendship, Putin forgave in Kudrin a lot that he would not have forgiven\nin anyone else. (Kudrin is now head of Russia's Accounts Chamber, and has not taken the risk of\nexpressing any public doubt over Putin's actions.)\n\nChubais played strictly by the rules, never criticizing Putin. He believed that Russia's political and\neconomic systems could be improved even under an authoritarian regime. The most important thing was\nnot to protest, but to make a contribution to the country's development. This stance was controversial\nwithin the democratic camp. Chubais was accused of appeasement, and of being naïve or cynically\nopportunistic.\n\nOne of Chubais's gentle opponents was his close friend Yegor Gaidar, the main architect of Russia's\npost-Soviet economic and political reforms, and a moral authority for many democratic-minded\nintellectuals in Russia. Gaidar died in 2009, and in recent times, Chubais often said that he would have\ndisagreed with his friend, who categorically did not believe that authoritarian modernization was possible.\n\nOn Gaidar's birthday, March 19, Chubais wrote on social media that his late friend had, after all, turned\nout to have been "strategically correct." This was a signal that Chubais had lost hope in the possibility of\nany development in Russia under Putin. It was an admission of defeat: the defeat of a more than 40-year\nmission by young Soviet economists, first to draw up reforms, and then to implement them under Yeltsin.\n\nChaubis's actions indicate that as well as no longer believing in Russia's future, he feared for his own\nsafety. He has many enemies within Russia's security services, who see him as a symbol of Russia's\nliberal development and would like nothing better than to destroy him.\n\nWhat we are seeing is not a schism within Russia's elites. The elites are united in their support of Putin.\nThey are essentially trapped in a submarine with him, and will either sink or swim together with the\npresident. A case in point is that of Elvira Nabiullina, the respected head of Russia's central bank, as\nreported by the The Wall Street Journal: She handed in her resignation, but Putin simply refused to\naccept it. No conspiracy against the dictator is possible, either within the state apparatus, or in political\ncircles, or by the oligarchs. There is too little unity among these people. They do not trust each other,\nand—most importantly—they are paralyzed with fear, just like Stalin's associates in the final years of his\nlife.\n\nPutin once said that liberalism in Russia was obsolete. Now that theory has been put into practice.\nNaturally, the disappearance of the last few liberals from government coincides with the most\nnightmarish course of action the Putin regime could have possibly embarked upon. An act that has\ndestroyed all the achievements of the Yeltsin era and put an end to the Russia that Chubais, Gaidar, and\ntheir colleagues had tried to build. We must accept the fact that the compromises made by Russia's\nliberals with regard to Putin have led the country into a dead end.\n\nGuest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's and MarketWatch\nnewsroom.

      <td>\nIn a secret chat room run by a group of Russian-affiliated cybercriminals, a hacker expressed\nexcitement about a plan to attack and disable more than 400 U.S. hospitals. "There will be panic," the\nhacker wrote, in Russian.\n\nIt was 2020, at a severe point in the pandemic, and the gang planned to hold hostage the computer\nsystems of the hospitals, many of which were fighting to save Covid-19 patients.\n</td>
      <td>\nU.S. authorities and cybersecurity researchers foiled large parts of the plan, warning hospitals before\nthe hackers' ransomware could be installed, but the hackers shrugged off the setback, according to a\ncache of data and documents leaked online in recent weeks.\n\nThe hacking enterprise, called the Trickbot Group by federal prosecutors, and its affiliates had already\ncollected hundreds of millions of dollars by shutting down emergency rooms, city governments and\npublic schools since 2018.\n\n"I find it all funny," wrote a Trickbot hacker who used the pseudonym "target," in a message, after the\nplan was thwarted, to "stern," the group's leader and paymaster.\n\nThis wide-open view of the inner workings of what is perhaps the world's biggest and most dangerous\norganized cybercrime group is a surprising consequence of the war in Ukraine. An anonymous\nresearcher who had infiltrated the group's servers, and who identified himself as Ukrainian, posted the\ndata on Twitter on Feb. 27. "Ukraine will Rise!" he then wrote in a March 2 tweet.\n\nSecurity researchers and U.S. officials say the internal conversations amount to the most complete\nand candid public look yet at the operations of a criminal ransomware enterprise. U.S. authorities\nhave been tracking the Trickbot group, but little was known publicly about its operations and internal\ndeliberations before the cache of documents surfaced.\n\nMore than 200,000 messages exchanged by 450 Trickbot managers, staff and business partners\nsince June 2020 reveal a well-organized criminal syndicate with possible connections to Russian\nintelligence agencies. They show an organizational resilience that allowed the group to rapidly\nrecover from counterattacks by law enforcement, and grand ambitions to diversify and develop a\ncryptocurrency.\n\nLife inside the group swings wildly between the dangerous and the mundane, with managers at once\nhatching extravagant plans, such as opening a pro-Russian espionage division, while also budgeting\nvacation time and smoothing over workforce conflicts.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine last month prompted the researcher to leak the information, according to\ntwo people who know him and can verify the work he did to capture Trickbot communications and\npass them on to Western cybersecurity professionals. The researcher didn't respond to requests for\ncomment sent to him via an intermediary.\n\nU.S. law-enforcement officials haven't publicly verified the materials. Cybersecurity researchers and\nformer security officials say the chat logs and other leaked documents appeared to be authentic. The\nFederal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment.\n\nThe data include technical details that align with attacks using ransomware called Conti that Trickbot\nhas previously claimed, as well as a breach previously attributed by security experts to another strain\nof ransomware developed by the group called Ryuk, according to an analysis of the data by The Wall\nStreet Journal.\n\nA malware developer participating in the chats used a nickname previously identified in a federal\nindictmentas a coder for Trickbot. And gaps in the logs coincide with periods when the group's\ncomputer infrastructure was known to have been disrupted, according to security researchers and the\nsecurity blogger Brian Krebs.\n\nRansomware locks up a target computer network's files until payment is made for their release. It has\nballooned as a criminal enterprise in recent years. The U.S. Treasury Department said last fall that\nransomware payments by American companies that were flagged by U.S. banks in the first six\nmonths of 2021 had nearly doubled to almost $600 million from the previous year's period.\n\nPresident Biden began putting pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin last summer to take\naction to limit ransomware originating in Russia. Much of the world's cybercrime -- including\nransomware -- originates there or in Eastern Europe, say security researchers and government\nofficials.\n\nRussia has denied U.S. accusations its state security apparatus is involved with cybercrime or\ntolerates it. Russia's embassy in Washington didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nOfficials say cybercriminal groups could target the U.S. as a form of retaliation for the West's support\nfor Ukraine against Moscow's invasion. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security\nAgency and U.S. Cyber Command, warned during a Senate hearing this month that Russia could\nbecome more likely to lash out with ransomware or other aggressive cyberattacks as the Ukraine\nconflict drags on.\n\nOn Monday, a Ukrainian internet service provider used by the country's military suffered a massive\ncyberattack, disrupting its services. Officials didn't say who was responsible.\n\nMr. Biden last week said evolving intelligence indicated the Kremlin was looking to target the U.S. with\ncyberattacks in response to economic sanctions.\n\nU.S. officials are weighing whether to sanction the Trickbot group, according to sources familiar with\nthe Treasury Department's thinking. Such a move would make it illegal for U.S. companies to pay its\nransomware demands.\n\nTrickbot is one of the most prolific and widely feared of the ransomware groups, and its Conti\nransomware was the most used in 2021, according to cyber-threat researchers at Unit 42, at Palo Alto\nNetworks. Trickbot runs an affiliate program that allows other criminals to sign up as partners and\nwield the group's ransomware, servers and ransom negotiators in exchange for payment.\n\nThe group's Conti ransomware strain was used in 16 targeted attacks on U.S. emergency responders\nlast year, including hospitals and 911 call centers, according to the FBI. It was also used in attacks on\nIreland's national healthcare system that forced doctors to cancel stroke and cancer treatments. The\ngroup's other ransomware code, Ryuk, has been used in attacks on at least 235 general hospitals and\nother healthcare facilities in the U.S. since 2018.\n\nOn Feb. 27, the anonymous researcher posted nearly two years of data -- private chat messages,\nfinancial information, source code and other technical details -- which he described as belonging to\nthe operators of the Conti ransomware.\n\nThe leaks depict a highly professional and ruthless ransomware organization at the top of its game,\nsaid John Fokker, head of cyber investigations with the security firm Trellix. "They don't care if they go\nafter a hospital," he said. "It's all about making money."\n\nThe anonymous source of the leak is one of a handful of cybersecurity analysts who have been\nsecretly infiltrating Trickbot's electronic infrastructure, according to Alex Holden, a security analyst\nwhose company, Hold Security, monitors Eastern European cybercrime and Trickbot. The\nresearchers have recorded private chats undetected and undermined some of the group's plans.\n\nIn September 2020, U.S. officials at U.S. Cyber Command and elsewhere were successful in freeing\nthousands of computers from the hackers' control, according to current and former officials and others\nfamiliar with the operation. The network of machines had been infected for the purpose of conducting\ncyberattacks, they said.\n\n\n\nAt around the same time, Microsoft Corp. worked with a world-wide coalition of technology companies\nto block servers at eight U.S. hosting companies that Trickbot rented to run the back-end of its\noperations.\n\nThe chat messages show flashes of frustration with the counterattack. "[T]hese offline bots will\ndemoralize everyone," one Trickbot manager complained, referring to the hacked PCs that abruptly\nstopped accepting orders from the group.\n\nThe group began rebuilding its network of compromised computers immediately, and within weeks\nhad returned to full strength and started a dangerous revenge plot, the messages show. The hackers\nbegan methodically penetrating U.S. hospitals, intent on simultaneously crippling hundreds of them as\nthey struggled with rising Covid infections.\n\nCybersecurity researchers who had been tracking the group warned U.S. authorities, and the\nDepartment of Homeland Security warned hospitals. Cybersecurity experts worked to minimize the\ndamage. "I don't think I've ever been as scared as I was that week," said Joshua Corman, former\nchief strategist with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Covid Task Force, a\nHomeland Security group set up to protect the healthcare sector during the pandemic.\n\nAfter the hospital attack plan was countered, the messages show Trickbot managers searching for\nhow their plans leaked. "Checked everything back and forth, there's nothing on the PC, no traffic\nleaks," one of the group reported to "stern."\n\nThough the coordinated hospital attacks didn't work out, funds were flowing in from desperate victims\nin other corporate sectors. The group's Conti ransomware business received payments of $70 million\nin 2020 and more than $200 million in 2021, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. As of\nearly March, it had taken in $13.5 million, Chainalysis said.\n\nThe chats offer a number of references to possible connections between the Trickbot gang and\nRussian security officials.\n\n"We can see conversations that are very suggestive that at least a small portion of these threat actors\nmight have some sort of relationship with Russian intelligence or the Russian government apparatus,"\nwhere the hackers may work to obtain intelligence for the government, said Kimberly Goody, director\nof cybercrime analysis with the security firm Mandiant.\n\nIn October, a member called "kagas" passed along word of a newly reopened investigation in Russia\ninto the group spurred by a request from U.S. officials.\n\n"[T]he investigator said why it was renewed -- the Americans officially requested information on\nRussian hackers. . .We were summoned by the investigator next Tuesday for a talk, but sort of as\nwitnesses for now."\n\nEarlier last year, members of the group discussed specifically targeting "people who work against the\nRussian Federation," instead of limiting their attacks to large corporations that can afford sizable\nransom payments, their previous strategy.\n\nOne of the hackers claimed to have breached the email of a reporter at the open-source\ninvestigations organization Bellingcat, and scoured for information on an investigation implicating\nRussia's FSB, its civilian intelligence agency, in the 2020 nerve agent poisoning of Russian opposition\nleader Alexei Navalny. "Of course we are patriots," another group member wrote.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine stirred patriotic sentiments in some group members. "Happy holidays,\ncyber troops!" wrote one group member on Feb. 23, Defender of the Fatherland Day in Russia and\nthe day Russian troops entered Donbas, a day before the broader invasion. "Let's beat the\nAmericans!"\n\nAt other times, group members resemble the nerds and schemers on the HBO television series\n"Silicon Valley." The logs show some members pitching senior managers on pet projects and new\nmonetization strategies. "While I was sleeping, I came up with a very cool idea," wrote a midlevel\nmanager called "Mango," who then proposed a micropayment auction system to sell uncooperative\nvictims' stolen data in dribs and drabs.\n\nThe group maintained offices in Moscow, which it used to recruit new talent, but, like other\nbusinesses, switched to a work-from-home model during the Covid outbreak, according to Vitali\nKremez, the chief executive with the security company AdvIntel, who reached those conclusions\nbased on his own intelligence gathering.\n\n\n\nHackers took breaks to visit the dentist, the chats show, and appeared to have human-resources\nstaff. The hackers talk about the struggle to recruit technical talent, tell jokes, grouse about vacation\nand even muse about launching their own cryptocurrency blockchain.\n\nLast year, the FBI arrested Alla Witte, a Latvian national accused of serving as one of the cybercrime\ngroup's key developers. The hackers worked to hire a lawyer for Ms. Witte, and discussed using their\nransom profits to fund her defense. Their strategy would be to portray Ms. Witte as an unwitting\naccomplice to the group's crimes, wrote "Mango": "We will try to make a victim out of her, got a job on\nthe Internet, didn't see who she was working with."\n\nThe group tried to steer victims toward preferred ransomware negotiating companies and pressure\nvictims to submit to escalating extortion demands. In one of the chats, Trickbot's operators claim to\nhave a journalist, whose name and organization wasn't revealed, on the payroll who would take a 5%\ncommission on extortion payments in exchange for pressuring victims by threatening critical coverage\nof breaches.\n\nIn late February, Trickbot announced it was supporting the Kremlin and threatened to respond\nforcefully to any cyberattacks against Russia.\n\nThat prompted the researcher to release megabytes of logs, code and documents he had compiled\nfrom his time monitoring the group, according to Mr. Holden, the security analyst at Hold Security.\n\n"The gang itself is in shambles," said Mr. Holden, indicating the leak disrupted the group's operations.\n"We've seen them try to reassemble a little bit, but they're not rebuilding in any meaningful way."\n\nThe large leak was followed in early March by a smaller dump by the same researcher of chat logs\ncapturing the hackers' response to the leak. The logs show Trickbot scrambling to rip down\ninfrastructure and destroy evidence. "Who leaked?" one member demanded.\n\n---\n\nMauro Orru contributed to this article.\n\n\n\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nThe ruble is in a central-bank-induced coma.\n\nWhile Russia's currency can still see sharp swings in a day, it has trimmed its steep losses and\nbegun to stabilize. It is now trading at about 99 rubles to the dollar, roughly 17% weaker than it was\nbefore Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 but stronger than its record low of 151 on March\n7, according to FactSet.\n</td>
      <td>\nRising currency prices often reflect a general strengthening of a country's economic outlook. Not so\nin Russia.\n\nRather, central bank moves to limit ruble selling and force ruble buying have effectively\nmanufactured demand for the currency.\n\nRussia capped the amount of dollars that residents can withdraw from foreign-currency bank\naccounts and barred banks from selling foreign currencies to customers for the next six months.\n\nRussian brokerages also aren't allowed to let foreign clients sell securities. These measures have\nmade it more difficult to sell the ruble, thereby limiting its losses.\n\nWestern sanctions against Russia left carve-outs for exporters of energy upon which Europe is\nparticularly dependent, which kept dollars and euros flowing into the country. Russia ordered those\nexporters to sell 80% of their foreign-currency revenues and buy rubles, helping the currency\nappreciate.\n\n"It is fair to say that the ruble is not a market price," said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the\nInstitute of International Finance. "If there were a free flow in both directions, we would see a far\nweaker ruble."\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin recently said he wants European nations to begin buying Russian\ngas with rubles rather than dollars and euros. That would reverse the current flow of money, making\nsanctioning nations support Russia's currency and ensuring that all funds from energy sales support\nits value, said Christian Kopf, head of fixed income at asset manager Union Investment. Such a\nmove is unlikely, but it signals Russia's desire to boost demand for the ruble.\n\nCurrencies often move with the ups and downs of a country's economy. Investors want to put money\ninto economies they think will thrive, buying stocks and bonds denominated in that country's tender.\n\nIt is harder to take such insights from the ruble.\n\nHundreds of companies have announced a withdrawal from Russia, meaning imports are likely to\ncontract. At the same time, Russia is continuing to sell its oil, meaning exports and money gained\nfrom those will more than make up for the money necessary for imports.\n\nOil prices above $100 a barrel are also adding a boost to revenue, even as Moscow's inventories\ntrade at a discount. The imbalance could strengthen the ruble, though it doesn't make Russia's\neconomy any stronger.\n\n"There's so much stuff you're not allowed to buy or sell," said George Pearkes, a macro strategist at\nBespoke Investment Group. "The ruble could strengthen a lot from here, and it wouldn't mean\nanything."\n\nAfter the war broke out, the ruble market split to have one value within Russia and another on\ninternational markets. In onshore trading, Russia's currency was valued at 94 rubles to the dollar on\nMonday, while it traded at 98 in international markets. That gap has narrowed from early March.\n\nRussian banks offered slightly fewer rubles for customers' dollars than the Moscow Exchange on\nMonday. Sberbank PJSC offered about 89 rubles for a dollar while the Russian website of Austria's\nRaiffeisen Bank quoted 86.\n\nMany Western banks are no longer providing electronic quotes to buy and sell the ruble. Clients\ninstead must call the bank and ask if it is willing to process a trade and at what rate.\n\nBanks, worried about running afoul of Western sanctions, are having to clear every ruble transaction\nwith their legal and compliance departments, traders say.\n\nEuropean countries have announced plans to shift away from Russian energy in the coming years,\nwhich also would weaken the ruble over the long term.\n\n"We're looking at a Russian ruble that is longer-term significantly weakened," said Jane Foley, head\nof foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank.\n\n\n\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nU.S. lawmakers asked Credit Suisse Group AG to hand over information related to the bank's\ncompliance with sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a letter to Credit Suisse Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein on Monday, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney\n(D., N.Y.), chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D.,\nMass.), chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, asked the bank to hand over information\non its financing of yachts and aircraft owned by potentially sanctioned individuals.\n</td>
      <td>\nThey are seeking the information following reports that Credit Suisse instructed investors in a recent\ndebt deal to destroy and erase information related to its dealings with wealthy clients.\n\nThe debt deal, reported by the Financial Times in February, reduced some of the bank's exposure to\n$2 billion loans it made to rich clients to finance yachts and jets.\n\nThe FT reported that a presentation for the deal said there were four loan defaults in the 2017-18\nperiod because of U.S. sanctions against Russian oligarchs. It later reported investors had been\nasked to destroy deal documents.\n\n"This report raises significant concerns about Credit Suisse's compliance with the severe sanctions\nimposed by United States and its allies and partners on the architects and enablers of Russia's brutal\nand unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and oligarchs in his\ninner circle," the committee chairs wrote.\n\nA Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment on the letter and pointed to the bank's earlier\nremarks on the deal and sanctions. On March 3 the bank said it had asked investors who hadn't\nparticipated in the deal to destroy documents, citing market practice, and that it had nothing to do with\nrecent sanctions. It said no data was erased within Credit Suisse.\n\nThe lawmakers said they were particularly concerned that the instruction to destroy documents\ncoincided with Switzerland saying it would join other countries in applying sanctions.\n\nThere were also questions about whether investors in the deals had adequate information to comply\nwith sanctions if any of the loans had been made to sanctioned people.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Gottstein said Credit Suisse follows all U.S., U.K. and European Union\nsanctions as binding, and that Switzerland applying them Feb. 28 was "almost irrelevant."\n\nCredit Suisse has acknowledged freezing $5 billion in client assets in 2018 to comply with earlier\nsanctions imposed over Russia's aggression in Ukraine. It disclosed up to $1.1 billion in exposure to\nRussia earlier this month and said exposure to sanctioned individuals was minimal.\n\nThe committee wants to review a list of the investors in the deal, as well as documents pertaining to\nCredit Suisse's due diligence on the deal and its underlying assets in relation to sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe committee requested all communications and documents relating to any instructions to destroy\nthe deal-related information, as reported by the FT. The lawmakers also are seeking any bank\ncommunications with the owners of the underlying assets.\n\nIn the letter, the committee asked Credit Suisse for documents dating back to Jan. 1, 2017, by April\n11.\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nRIGA, Latvia -- For years, the Kremlin thought it had a toehold in the Baltic states that were once part\nof the Soviet Union. Large numbers of Russian speakers, many of whom were left behind after the fall\nof the Iron Curtain, provided Moscow a way to sway public opinion and undermine the West's\nexpansion toward Russia's borders, security officials say.\n\nNow those old allegiances are being tested and generational divides exposed by President Vladimir\nPutin's war on Ukraine.\n</td>
      <td>\nIn Latvia, many young ethnic Russians say they try to sidestep what is happening there when talking\nwith older family members, fearing it might damage their relationships.\n\n"I try to avoid the topic," said Sophia Dubova, a 16-year-old fruit seller in a central market of Riga. She\nsaid her parents watched Russian state media until those channels were blocked, but she gets her\nnews from Ukrainian citizens and journalists on Telegram, the messaging site. Nearly 100\nRussia-based television networks and websites have been blocked in Latvia since the invasion began\nand at least five activists were arrested this month for their allegedly pro-Russian sympathies as\nsecurity forces try to limit the Kremlin's reach.\n\nOther young people are trying to change the minds of the older generation by gently feeding them with\ninformation that doesn't come from Moscow.\n\nJournalist Anna Leitland-Grigorjeva and her husband, Arturs, an engineer, run a YouTube channel\nwhere she interviews experts about the war in Russian. The couple have only carefully broached the\nsubject of the war with her parents back in Russia, and his in Riga.\n\n"It's important to speak to them without aggression," said Ms. Leitland-Grigorjeva, who was born in\nRussia and was a Putin supporter when she arrived in Latvia in 2017 but soon changed her views.\n"We're trying to help people find their own way to the truth."\n\nWhether they and others like them succeed could determine Russia's future influence among its aging\npockets of sympathizers, for whom the wounds of the Cold War had never fully healed.\n\nA 2017 report by Rand Corp., a U.S. think tank, said Russia might try to mobilize loyal groups in Latvia\nand Estonia to declare independence and invite Russian troops to annex territory, akin to what\nbreakaway groups did in the Ukrainian Donbas region in 2014.\n\n"The leadership in the Kremlin very much wants to use Russophone minorities outside Russia for their\npolitical purposes," said Janis Kazocins, national security adviser to the Latvian president. "It's a way to\nweaken the country by creating splits in society."\n\nNormunds Mezviets, director-general of the Latvian domestic intelligence agency, agreed, saying\nMoscow's goal was to chip away at Latvia's membership in the European Union and the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization.\n\n\n\n\nOther European countries have enclaves of Russian support. The rifts run deepest in Latvia, where\n37% of the population are Russian speakers and 25% of the population are ethnic Russians.\n\nAfter Latvia gained independence in 1991, many Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians and other\nethnicities stayed in the country. But in 1995, hundreds of thousands of them were effectively made\nsecond-class citizens, said Elizabete Krivcova, a lawyer in Riga who focuses on minority rights. A new\nlaw placed noncitizen status on ethnic minorities from the former Soviet Union whose ancestors didn't\nhave citizenship from Latvia's first period of independence from 1918 to 1940.\n\nNoncitizens can't vote or work as civil servants, police or practice law. Gaining citizenship requires\npassing a language exam that many aren't able to pass. About 10% of Latvia's population remain\nnoncitizens, according to the Latvian Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs.\n\nMany Russian speakers have pro-European social views but lean toward the Kremlin on geopolitical\nissues, said Martins Kaprans, an expert on Russian-speaking minorities in post-Soviet states at the\nUniversity of Latvia.\n\nHowever, the war in Ukraine could change views among Russian speakers, he said, weakening\nMoscow's leverage in the community.\n\n"This is an existential tipping point for Russophone Latvians," Mr. Kaprans said. "Russia is the source\nof their collective identity and language, and the image of Russia as a peaceful country will be very\nhard to maintain."\n\nFor some, but not all.\n\nAlthough traditionally pro-Russian political parties have condemned Mr. Putin's war, public-opinion\npolls suggest loyalties are more divided. An independent opinion poll conducted in March for Latvian\ntelevision showed only 22% of Russian speakers supported Ukraine in the current war, compared with\n90% of ethnic Latvians. Some 21% of Russian speakers supported Russia and 57% declined to take\nsides or found it difficult to answer.\n\nThe clampdown on Russian state media and pro-Russian activists has prompted some critics to say\nLatvia could be worsening the disaffection many Russian speakers feel.\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nTEL AVIV -- Israel is bracing for one of the biggest waves of non-Jewish refugees in its history, as\nincoming Ukrainians force the country to balance its historic desire to help people fleeing war with its\nresponsibility as a haven for Jews.\n\nAbout 18,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Israel but two-thirds of them don't have Jewish roots.\nWhile most of the 3.7 million Ukrainians who have fled the war are headed to neighboring European\ncountries, the influx has jolted Israel, which has a population of 9.3 million.\n</td>
      <td>\nSome Israeli officials fear that an unchecked wave of refugees could undercut the country's Jewish\nmajority. Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics said in 2021 that 74% of Israel's population identify as\nJewish, and 21% are Arab. A further 5% are largely non-Arab Christians, most of whom were among or\nborn to the nearly one million immigrants from the former Soviet Union who came to Israel during the\n1990s.\n\nIsraeli Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked on March 8 announced a policy to cap non-Jewish refugees from\nUkraine at 5,000 while permitting an additional 20,000 Ukrainians residing in Israel largely without legal\nstatus before the war to remain during the hostilities.\n\nFive days later, Ms. Shaked changed course after she was condemned from centrist and left-wing\nmembers of her government. The issue has similarly divided the country largely along political lines,\naccording to polls, with left-wing Israelis supporting a more-open policy to absorbing non-Jewish\nrefugees. The revised policy keeps the non-Jewish refugee quota at 5,000 but allows an uncapped\nnumber of Ukrainians with family in Israel to stay until the hostilities cease. It also requires Ukrainians\nto apply for approval from Israel before being allowed to board a plane to Tel Aviv.\n\nIsrael's current quota for Ukrainians entering the country and the requirement that they receive prior\napproval while abroad effectively suspended a visa-waiver agreement Israel has with Ukraine. The\nnearby United Arab Emirates took a similar step in early March before quickly backtracking.\n\nOn Monday, Israeli officials said they were approaching the quota, with 4,975 non-Jewish Ukrainian\nrefugees without family in Israel here.\n\nMs. Shaked has said her policy is meant to give priority to Ukrainians with Jewish roots who are eligible\nfor citizenship. "We have to remember that the state of Israel is a national homeland of the Jewish\npeople," Ms. Shaked said. She has argued that, relative to the size of its population, Israel is expected\nto take in and naturalize more Ukrainian refugees than any other country that doesn't border Ukraine.\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticized Israel's refugee policy in a Zoom-hosted speech\nto Israeli lawmakers. "Why isn't Israeli help, or even entry permits, forthcoming," he said.\n\nMr. Zelensky, who is Jewish, compared Ukrainians fleeing the war to Jews escaping Nazi persecution\nduring the Holocaust. That specific appeal drew outrage from a largely Jewish audience, who\nconsidered the comparison incorrect and unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's Supreme Court had given the government until Monday to revise the current policy before\nruling whether the quota of Ukrainian refugees and the requirement for entry approval from abroad is\nlegal. On Monday, Ms. Shaked notified the court that the existing quota would remain in place.\n\nThe petition to the court is backed by Ukraine's embassy in Tel Aviv. Israeli officials have argued the\nvisa-waiver program is for touristic purposes, while those fleeing war would be more likely to remain in\nthe country.\n\n"We showed that the law relates to any visitor from Ukraine and to any purpose, not only tourism, and\nthe Supreme Court hinted that indeed this is how they see it," said Tomer Warsha, who filed the\npetition challenging the current refugee policy.\n\nIsrael has sought to balance its close relationship with the U.S. and Europe with diplomatic and security\nties it has developed with Moscow in recent years.\n\nIsrael's position is that it opposes Russia's invasion of Ukraine but can provide only humanitarian -- not\nmilitary -- aid to maintain its ties with Russia. Moscow has forces in Syria, where Israel has been\nconducting a long-running aerial campaign against Iranian-backed militants. Israel has a deconfliction\nline of communication with Russia to prevent the possibility of unintended clashes over Syrian skies.\nIsrael has established a field hospital in Ukraine and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is one of a\nhandful of state leaders mediating between Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nUkrainian officials say some non-Jewish refugees have been mistreated as they tried to enter the\ncountry, in contrast to the relatively easy process for refugees with Jewish roots.\n\nYulia Tomin, a 25-year-old refugee who fled her hometown of Ivano-Frankivsk with her two young\nchildren and her grandmother, isn't Jewish but has Israeli relatives. She said she slept on the floor in\nthe airport from March 8 to March 11 while nursing her 1-month-old son and trying to take care of her\n4-year-old daughter. She was transferred to a hotel and slated for deportation before an immigration\nlawyer took up her case and won. Israel's immigration authority hasn't responded to a request for\ncomment on Ms. Tomin's case.\n\nAlla Misiuk and her daughter are among about a dozen non-Jewish families being brought to Israel with\nthe help of Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum because their families saved the lives of Jews\nduring World War II. She doesn't know if they will be allowed to stay in Israel permanently. "My home is\ndestroyed. There is no place to go back to," she said.\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nHeineken NV and Carlsberg A/S, the world's second- and third-largest global brewers, respectively,\nsaid they would exit Russia, joining a growing list of major Western companies leaving the country.\n\nThe moves by the beer giants further narrow the pool of big global companies still doing business in\nRussia. Hundreds of businesses, including fast-food chains, auto makers, oil giants and banks, have\nsaid they are pausing or ending operations in Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.\n</td>
      <td>\nHeineken and Carlsberg previously had halted new investments in Russia and scaled back some\noperations, while continuing to do business there. On Monday, they said they had reviewed their\noperations and decided to dispose of their assets in the country. Upon completion of the moves,\nneither will have a presence in Russia.\n\nThe decision is particularly significant for Carlsberg, which is among the Western companies with the\nbiggest exposure to Russia. The Danish brewer generates about 10% of its annual revenue and more\nthan 6% of its operating profit from Russia, where it owns eight breweries and has about 8,400\nemployees.\n\n"We have taken the difficult and immediate decision to seek a full disposal of our business in Russia,\nwhich we believe is the right thing to do in the current environment," Carlsberg Chief Executive Cees 't\nHart said.\n\nThe company warned of a "substantial" noncash impairment charge related to the disposal. It said any\nprofit generated from its Russian business during the war would be donated to relief organizations.\n\nDutch rival Heineken said it decided to leave Russia after a review concluded that ownership of its\nbusiness there was "no longer sustainable nor viable in the current environment."\n\nHeineken said it would continue to pay its 1,800 staff in Russia until the end of the year and that it\nwouldn't profit from any transfer of ownership of its operations there. It added that the move would\nresult in a one-off charge of 400 million euros, equivalent to $440 million.\n\nThe exits leave Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA as the last remaining major global\nbrewer to retain a presence in Russia. The world No. 1 beer company has asked joint venture partner,\nTurkey's Anadolu Efes, to suspend brewing Bud in Russia and has said it would forfeit its profits from\nthe joint venture. AB InBev doesn't disclose how much revenue it earns through the Efes joint venture\nin which it has a noncontrolling stake. A spokeswoman previously described it as immaterial.\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nTOKYO -- The global crisis over Russia's invasion of Ukraine is also a hometown one for Japanese\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida, because constituents in his Hiroshima district rely on Russian gas to\ncook their dinners.\n\nJapan and European nations have excluded Russian natural gas and oil from the sanctions they\nimposed after President Vladimir Putin started the Ukraine war, allowing Mr. Putin to keep his principal\nsource of foreign currency. Mr. Kishida says Japan's energy security would be imperiled by a sudden\ncutoff.\n</td>
      <td>\nThe situation is particularly acute in Hiroshima prefecture, part of which Mr. Kishida represents in\nparliament. Hiroshima Gas Co. gets about half its gas from Russia, a much higher proportion than the\nrest of Japan.\n\nIt is one example of how the web of connections between Russia and the global economy make it\nhard for leaders of democracies to punish Mr. Putin for the Ukraine invasion without blowback at\nhome. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has ruled out canceling its Russian energy deals for now,\nsaying that would plunge all of Europe into recession.\n\nWestern companies continue to sell products like cosmetics and ice cream in Russia, while Japan\nTobacco Inc., one-third owned by the Japanese government, is keeping its large Russian cigarette\nbusiness.\n\nJapan imports most of its energy, including natural gas from the Russian island of Sakhalin in the Far\nEast just north of Japan. At a news conference on March 16, Mr. Kishida was asked about the\nSakhalin gas field and responded, "In terms of stable supply of energy, I view this as an important\nproject for our nation."\n\nOverall, Japan gets about 9% of its natural gas from Russia. But Hiroshima Gas committed itself more\ndeeply to Moscow in a 2006 deal under which it is importing up to 210,000 tons of liquefied natural gas\nfrom Sakhalin every year from 2008 to 2028. The company says that contract accounts for about half\nthe gas it needs annually.\n\nA Hiroshima Gas spokesman said supplies from Sakhalin were coming in normally. The company is\nwatching the situation and planning for alternatives should Russian gas be cut off, he said.\n\nHiroshima Gas is based in the central Hiroshima city district represented since the 1990s by Mr.\nKishida. Starting in 2009, Hiroshima Gas executive Hideki Fukayama, then president and\nsubsequently chairman, donated 240,000 yen, equivalent to $2,000, each year to the ruling Liberal\nDemocratic Party's political organization in the district, which is headed by Mr. Kishida.\n\nAfter Mr. Fukayama retired as chairman in June 2017, he halted his donations and the new chairman,\nKozo Tamura, started donating at the same $2,000-a-year pace through 2020, the most recent year\nfor which records are available. Mr. Tamura was one of only three individuals in that year to donate\nmore than $500.\n\n\n\nHiroshima Gas and a representative of Mr. Kishida said the donations were personal and had nothing\nto do with the company's business. The donations were within legal limits and reported as required by\nthe ruling party. The company declined to make Mr. Tamura available to comment, and calls to\nnumbers listed for him and Mr. Fukayama weren't answered.\n\nJapan paid more than $3 billion for Russian gas in 2021. If it had to replace that with supplies\npurchased at current sky-high spot prices, it would cost many more billions, analysts say.\n\n"The economic consequences would be forbidding," said Rystad Energy analyst Kaushal Ramesh. He\nobserved that Sakhalin gas is also convenient, taking just two days to get to Japanese ports,\ncompared with more than a month for many American shipments.\n\nAlready, a typical household in Tokyo is paying about 30% more for electricity than in early 2021\nbecause of high prices for natural gas and other fuels.\n\nThe prime minister's aides rejected the notion that Japan's purchases from Russia amounted to\nsignificant support for Mr. Putin's war machine. One aide said the Japanese money is less than a 10th\nof what European nations are paying. The aide said if Japan canceled its contracts, other buyers such\nas China would step in to buy the gas, perhaps at a higher price than Japan had locked in.\n\n"It would be more like sanctions on Japan than sanctions on Russia," he said.\n\nThe energy trade has been one of the few areas of cooperation between Japan and Russia amid a\nlong-running dispute over islands seized from Japan by Soviet troops at the end of World War II.\nFormer Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met Mr. Putin more than two dozen times in a fruitless effort to\nstrike a deal. On March 21, Russia's Foreign Ministry, citing Japan's sanctions, said it was ending the\ntalks.\n\n---\n\nChieko Tsuneoka contributed to this article.\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nA Ukrainian internet service provider used by the country's military suffered a massive cyberattack on\nMonday, Ukrainian officials said, fueling fears that Russia intends to wield more dangerous digital\nweapons as the war drags into its second month.\n\nThe attack on Ukrtelecom PJSC was described by some experts as among the most harmful\ncyberattacks since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. About 3:30 p.m. ET on Monday,\nUkrainian officials said that they had repelled the attack, and that the company could restore services,\naccording to a statement from Ukraine's State Service of Special Communication and Information\nProtection, which is responsible for cybersecurity in the country.\n</td>
      <td>\nThe Ukrainian cyber agency's statement didn't say who was responsible for the cyberattack. Security\nexperts have said Russian-linked hackers have launched a variety of cyberattacks against financial\nservices companies, internet service providers and government agencies since this February, in the\nrun-up to the Feb. 24 invasion and after.\n\nRussia has denied involvement in cyberattacks.\n\nUkrtelecom says it is the largest provider of landline telephone service in Ukraine. It is the\nseventh-largest internet service provider in the country, said Doug Madory, director of Internet analysis\nwith network-monitoring firm Kentik Inc.\n\nUkrtelecom's ability to connect to the internet to provide services to customers began dropping about 5\na.m. ET and gradually fell off throughout the day Monday, according to data from the Georgia Institute\nof Technology's Internet Outage Detection and Analysis project, which monitors internet blackouts.\nWithin five hours, the company was almost completely offline, Mr. Madory said.\n\nAfter the attack began, the company began limiting service to the majority of its business and\nconsumer customers to preserve capacity for its military customers, the SSSCIP said.\n\nAs of 4:30 p.m. ET, about 8% of the Ukrtelecom networks that the Georgia Tech internet outage\nproject measures were online.\n\nUkrtelecom didn't return messages seeking comment, but the company acknowledged service outages\nin a post Monday to its Facebook page, and said it was working to restore stable service as soon as\npossible.\n\nThe disruption was confirmed by multiple groups that monitor internet traffic. Netblocks, an internet\nobservatory that has tracked previous outages in Ukraine, said on Twitter that network data showed\n"an ongoing and intensifying nation-scale disruption to service, which is the most severe registered\nsince the invasion by Russia."\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity experts and U.S. officials have been surprised by the lack of major disruptive or\ndestructive cyberattacks during the Ukraine conflict, as Russia is widely viewed to have some of the\nmost capable state-sponsored hacking groups in the world, and Moscow has previously been blamed\nfor launching cyberattacks that disrupted Ukraine's government, electricity grid and financial services.\n\nThe malicious cyber activity has largely been confined to service disruptions of websites and the\nlimited deployment of so-called wiper malware, which can destroy computer files. Still, U.S. officials\nhave grown increasingly concerned that Moscow could lash out either in Ukraine or against the West\nin response to its struggles on the battlefield and punishing sanctions enacted by the U.S. and Europe.\n\nLast week, President Biden said there was evolving intelligence that suggested Russia was exploring\noptions to target the U.S. with cyberattacks.\n\nWrite to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com and Dustin Volz at dustin.volz@wsj.com\n\nInternet Provider to Ukrainian Military Hit With Major Cyberattack\n</td>

      <td>\nWASHINGTON—President Biden called for the largest-ever level of military spending and\nincreased funding for law enforcement in a $5.8 trillion budget, playing down his proposals for\nexpanding social programs in favor of backing initiatives generally favored by centrist\nlawmakers.\n\nThe budget, released Monday, also seeks higher taxes on businesses and the wealthiest\nAmericans, part of an emphasis on reducing the federal deficit that departs from last year's\nbudget that laid out ambitious spending increases.\n</td>
      <td>\nThe shift comes as Mr. Biden has struggled to move much of his agenda through Congress.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Biden's decline in opinion polls, and decades-high\ninflation have combined to pull many Democrats toward issues they see as better resonating\nwith voters.\n\n"Here's what this all adds up to: Historic deficit reduction, historic investment in our security at\nhome and abroad by modernizing our capabilities in both areas and an unprecedented\ncommitment to building an economy where everyone has a chance to succeed," Mr. Biden\nsaid of his budget in remarks Monday.\n\nDemocrats have narrow control of the House and the 50-50 Senate, and Republicans have\nlined up against many of the Biden administration's proposals. Democrats are bracing to lose\ncontrol of either or both chambers of Congress in the fall's midterm elections.\n\nThe administration is seeking $813 billion for military spending in fiscal year 2023, which\nbegins Oct. 1, a roughly 4% increase from the $782 billion enacted for this fiscal year. Budget\nfigures aren't adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe requested increase is more than double than the 1.6% boost the administration sought\nfor military spending in last year's budget. The proposal calls for $682 million in funding to go\nto Ukraine for efforts to counter Russiaand shore up its security and economic interests.\n\nThe proposed military spending would be the largest ever, if enacted, but it wouldn't be the\nbiggest one-year increase when compared with some previous years during the wars in Iraq\nand Afghanistan. The U.S. ended its 20-year war in Afghanistan in August, but is now working\nto address the crisis in Europe.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nWhat items would you like to see included in or removed from the budget request? Join the\nconversation below.\n\n\n\n\nU.S. military spending also will likely require additional long-term investments, particularly in\nthe Navy, to stay focused on China as the larger, more strategic threat facing the U.S.\nOfficials say investments in hypersonic missiles, machine learning, artificial intelligence and\nother military capabilities appropriate for confronting China will require billions of dollars in\nnew investments over time.\n\nWhile top Democrats cheered the Biden administration's request, some lawmakers were\ncritical, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee\nwho caucuses with Democrats.\n\n"At a time when we are already spending more on the military than the next 11 countries\ncombined, no we do not need a massive increase in the defense budget," Mr. Sanders said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said the administration's proposed increase\nin military funding was inadequate because it doesn't keep up with the rate of inflation, which\nrose nearly 8% from a year earlier in February.\n\n"The White House is desperately spinning to call this budget centrist, but there's nothing\nremotely moderate about what's in it," he said, pointing to the funding increases for\nnondefense agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn an interview, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said the assumptions about\ninflation might not be accurate in the next several months. "We built this budget on the\nabsolute best inflation information that we had at the time we built it back in the end of '21,"\nshe said, adding that some provisions were built into the budget that would make it "resilient\nto inflation." The budget, she said, also reflects planning since Russia invaded Ukraine the\nfirst time, in 2014.\n\nMr. Biden's budget also seeks more money for law enforcement. It proposes $17.4 billion for\nlaw enforcement at the Justice Department, including $1.7 billion to fight gun trafficking and\nfor other firearm-related efforts, and provides funding for the U.S. Marshals and the Federal\nBureau of Investigation to address violent crime. It also calls for funding 300 additional border\npatrol agent positions.\n\nOverall, the proposal seeks $769 billion for non-defense spending and the medical care\nprogram at Veterans Affairs in fiscal 2023, compared with the $691 billion Congress enacted\nfor those items in the current year.\n\nThe administration forecasts a yearly drop of roughly 50% in the U.S. deficit during fiscal\n2022, to $1.4 trillion, as spending on Covid-19 relief programs wanes and a stronger economy\ngenerates more tax revenue.\n\nThe budget plans would narrow the deficit by more than $1 trillion relative to where it would\nstand over a decade under current law. The budget projects debt held by the public would fall\nto 101.8% of U.S. GDP in fiscal 2023, compared with the White House's forecast of 102.4% in\nthe current year. Debt is expected to rise in subsequent years to 106.7% of GDP by 2032.\n\nThe budget projects "even by their own numbers, that the debt held by the public, which is\nhistorically at a high level right now at close to 100%, will continue to grow," said William\nHoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former senior\nRepublican congressional budget aide.\n\nMr. Biden and other top Democrats have in recent weeks talked up the party's work to trim the\ndeficit as they seek to win the support of Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) for their stalled\neconomic agenda.\n\n\n\n\nThe new budget proposal includes $17.4 billion for law enforcement and provides funding for\nthe FBI to address violent crime. PHOTO: Ariel Zambelich/The Wall Street Journal\n\nDemocrats remain in the early stages of figuring out how to resurrect that agenda—initially\ncalled Build Back Better—in a way that can win the support of centrists such Mr. Manchin,\nwho scuttled the House version of the legislation in the Senate. Mr. Manchin has said that he\nwould only support legislation that reduces the deficit, a step that he sees as a way to fight\ninflation.\n\nRather than lay out possible ways to overhaul the legislation, the White House budget broadly\nreiterates the Biden administration's goals for the bill, listing a series of policy\nideas—including free community college—that died during talks among Democrats last year.\nThe tax increases most likely to pass Congress soon, including a surtax on top earners, a\n15% minimum tax on corporations and higher taxes on U.S. companies' foreign earnings,\nwould be part of the revived bill.\n\nAdministration officials said they had segmented ideas related to the economic bill away from\nthe broader budget to give space for Democrats on Capitol Hill to continue talking.\n\nBen Ritz, director of the Center for Funding America's Future at the Progressive Policy\nInstitute, said the budget missed an opportunity to provide more direction to Congress about\nwhat the bill should look like.\n\n"I can understand why the administration would want to have some distance from the\nnegotiations to let them play out, but the decision to not have detailed policies on Build Back\nBetter creates this big blind spot," he said "That makes it very difficult to analyze the\naggregate fiscal impact of his agenda."\n\nThe budget includes a proposal for a 20% minimum tax rate on income, including unrealized\ngains in assets, for American households worth more than $100 million. This would apply to\nthe top 0.01% of households, the White House said. That is likely under 20,000 households.\n\nUnder current law, capital gains are taxed only when they are realized—when assets are\nsold—and long-term gains are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. The White House\nsaid that over the next decade the new tax would lower the U.S. deficit by about $360 billion.\n\nThe tax, which is unlikely to advance in Congress, could have its biggest impact on\nbillionaires such as Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, whose fortunes are largely composed of\nunrealized capital gains in the companies that they founded. Other people might have enough\nwealth to potentially be subject to the tax but not pay it. That could happen for athletes,\nentertainers and executives who pay high income-tax rates on their annual earnings.\n\nThe Biden administration would also earmark almost $82 billion over five years on preparing\nfor another pandemic and for biodefense, including investing in the making of vaccines.\n\nThe budget would start a program to provide uninsured adults access to all recommended\nvaccines. It also includes $9.9 billion in discretionary funds to build capacity at the Centers for\nDisease Control and PreventionCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and at the state\nand local levels, an increase of $2.8 billion over the 2021 enacted level.\n\nThe White House is proposing cutting the nation's immigration detention capacity by more\nthan 25%, from the 34,000 detention beds Congress funded for this year, down to a proposed\n25,000 for next year.\n\nThe proposal reflects the administration's desire to please immigration advocates after a year\nof maintaining several Trump administration immigration policies, and reflects its goal of\nreleasing more immigrants in the country illegally with ankle bracelets rather than jailing them.\n\nRichard Rubin, Gordon Lubold, Nancy A.

      <td>\nU.S. lawmakers asked Credit Suisse Group AG to hand over information related to the bank's\ncompliance with sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a letter to Credit Suisse Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein Monday, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D.,\nN.Y.), chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D.,\nMass.), chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, asked the bank to hand over information\non its financing of yachts and aircraft owned by potentially sanctioned individuals.\n</td>
      <td>\nThey are seeking the information following reports that Credit Suisse instructed investors in a recent\ndebt deal to destroy and erase information related to its dealings with rich clients.\n\nThe debt deal, first reported by the Financial Times in February, reduced some of the bank's exposure\nto $2 billion loans it made to wealthy clients to finance yachts and jets. The FT reported that a\npresentation for the deal said there were four loan defaults in the 2017-2018 period because of U.S.\nsanctions against Russian oligarchs. It later reported investors had been asked to destroy deal\ndocuments.\n\n"This report raises significant concerns about Credit Suisse's compliance with the severe sanctions\nimposed by United States and its allies and partners on the architects and enablers of Russia's brutal\nand unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and oligarchs in his\ninner circle," the committee chairs wrote.\n\nA Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment on the letter and pointed to the bank's earlier\ncomments on the deal and sanctions. On March 3 the bank said it had asked investors who hadn't\nended up participating in the deal to destroy documents, citing market practice, and that it had nothing\nto do with recent sanctions. It said no data was erased within Credit Suisse.\n\nThe lawmakers said they were particularly concerned that the instruction to destroy documents\ncoincided with Switzerland saying it would join other countries in applying sanctions. There were also\nquestions about whether investors in the deals had adequate information to comply with sanctions if\nany of the loans had been made to sanctioned people.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Gottstein said Credit Suisse follows all U.S., U.K. and European Union\nsanctions as binding, and that Switzerland applying them Feb. 28 was "almost irrelevant."\n\nCredit Suisse has acknowledged freezing $5 billion in client assets in 2018 to comply with earlier\nsanctions imposed over Russia's aggression in Ukraine. It disclosed up to $1.1 billion in exposure to\nRussia earlier this month and said exposure to sanctioned individuals was minimal.\n\nThe committee wants to review a list of the investors in the deal, as well as documents pertaining to\nCredit Suisse's due diligence on the deal and its underlying assets in relation to sanctions. The\n\n\ncommittee requested all communications and documents relating to any instructions to destroy the\ndeal-related information, as reported by the FT. The lawmakers also are seeking any bank\ncommunications with the owners of the underlying assets.\n\nIn the letter, the committee asked Credit Suisse for documents dating back to Jan. 1, 2017, by April\n11.\n\nWrite to Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com\n\nLawmakers Launch Probe of Credit Suisse Compliance With Russia Sanctions\n</td>

      <td>\nRIGA, Latvia—For years, the Kremlin thought it had a toehold in the Baltic states that were once part of\nthe Soviet Union. Large numbers of Russian-speakers, many of whom were left behind after the fall of\nthe Iron Curtain, provided Moscow a way to sway public opinion and undermine the West's expansion\ntoward Russia's borders, security officials say.\n\nNow those old allegiances are being tested and generational divides exposed by President Vladimir\nPutin's war on Ukraine.\n</td>
      <td>\nIn Latvia, many young ethnic Russians say they try to sidestep what is happening there when talking\nwith older family members, fearing it might damage their relationships.\n\n"I try to avoid the topic," said Sophia Dubova, a 16-year-old fruit seller in a central market of Riga.\n\nSporting a tongue stud and wearing a black hoodie under a puffer jacket, Ms. Dubova said her parents\nwatched Russian state media until those channels were blocked, but she gets her news from Ukrainian\ncitizens and journalists on Telegram, the messaging site. Nearly a hundred Russia-based television\nnetworks and websites have now been blocked in Latvia since the invasion began and at least five\nactivists were arrested this month for their allegedly pro-Russian sympathies as security forces try to\nlimit the Kremlin's reach.\n\nOther young people are trying to change the minds of the older generation by gently feeding them with\ninformation that doesn't come from Moscow.\n\nJournalist Anna Leitland-Grigorjeva and her husband, Arturs, who has a day job as an engineer, run a\nYouTube channel where she interviews experts about the war in Russian. The couple have only\ncarefully broached the subject of the war with her parents back in Russia, and his in Riga.\n\n"It's important to speak to them without aggression," said Ms. Leitland-Grigorjeva, who was born in\nRussia and was a Putin supporter when she arrived in Latvia in 2017 but soon changed her views.\n"We're trying to help people find their own way to the truth."\n\nWhether they and others like them succeed could determine Russia's future influence among its aging\npockets of sympathizers, for whom the wounds of the Cold War had never fully healed.\n\nA 2017 report by the Rand Corp., a U.S. think tank, said Russia might try to mobilize loyal groups in\nLatvia and Estonia to declare independence and invite Russian troops to annex territory, akin to what\nbreakaway groups did in the Ukrainian Donbas region in 2014.\n\n"The leadership in the Kremlin very much wants to use Russophone minorities outside Russia for their\npolitical purposes," said Janis Kazocins, national security adviser to the Latvian president. "It's a way to\nweaken the country by creating splits in society."\n\n\nNormunds Mezviets, director general of the Latvian domestic intelligence agency, agreed, saying\nMoscow's goal was to chip away at Latvia's membership in the European Union and the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization. "The overall aim of Russia's propaganda activities is to secure the support for the\nKremlin worldview and to erode trust in Latvia's statehood," he said.\n\nOther European countries have enclaves of Russian support, whether based on language or religious\nand cultural ties. In Moldova, Russian troops are present alongside pro-Russian separatists in the\nbreakaway region of Transnistria, which borders Ukraine. In Serbia, where NATO bombardments\nduring the Kosovo war are keenly remembered, protesters recently mobilized a mass protest in support\nof Mr. Putin.\n\nThe rifts run deepest in Latvia, where 37% of the population are Russian speakers, including half of the\ncapital Riga, and 25% of the population are ethnic Russians.\n\nMany feel alienated, marginalized by successive votes against including Russian as an official\nlanguage, and the use of Russian in schools has long been a political lightning rod, with nationalist\nparties seeking to ban it entirely.\n\n"We have no rights," said Sergey, a Russian speaker and retired cartoonist in western Riga. "Is this\ndemocracy?"\n\nAfter Latvia gained independence in 1991, many Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians and other\nethnicities stayed in the country. But in 1995, hundreds of thousands of them were effectively made\nsecond-class citizens, said Elizabete Krivcova, a lawyer in Riga who focuses on minority rights. A new\nlaw placed noncitizen status on ethnic minorities from the former Soviet Union whose ancestors didn't\nhave citizenship from Latvia's first period of independence from 1918 to 1940.\n\nNoncitizens can't vote or work as civil servants, police or practice law. Gaining citizenship requires\npassing a language exam that many aren't able to pass. About 10% of Latvia's population remain\nnoncitizens, according to the Latvian Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs.\n\nMany Russian speakers have pro-European social views but lean toward the Kremlin on geopolitical\nissues, said Martins Kaprans, an expert on Russian-speaking minorities in post-Soviet states at the\nUniversity of Latvia.\n\nHowever, the war in Ukraine could change views among Russian speakers, he said, weakening\nMoscow's leverage in the community.\n\n"This is an existential tipping point for Russophone Latvians," said Mr. Kaprans. "Russia is the source\nof their collective identity and language, and the image of Russia as a peaceful country will be very\nhard to maintain."\n\nFor some, but not all.\n\nAlthough traditionally pro-Russian political parties have condemned Mr. Putin's war, public opinion polls\nsuggest loyalties are more divided. An independent opinion poll conducted in March for Latvian\ntelevision showed only 22% of Russian speakers supported Ukraine in the current war, compared with\n90% of ethnic Latvians. Some 21% of Russian speakers supported Russia and 57% declined to take\nsides or found it difficult to answer.\n\nThe clampdown on Russian state media and pro-Russian activists has prompted some critics to say\nthat Latvia could be worsening the disaffection many Russian speakers already feel.\n\n"There must be space for different opinions," said Yuri Alekseev, a prominent pro-Moscow journalist\nwho runs a Russian-language opinion website that Latvian authorities allege spreads ethnic hatred.\n"When Big Brother tells you to only have one opinion, that's when such a thing as fascism starts."\n\nHe was sentenced to 14 months in prison for some of the content he posted online, and for possession\nof ammunition and child pornography. He appealed the sentence, saying the bullets found in his\napartment were planted during a search, and the photos considered pornographic by the court were of\nhis grandchildren bathing.\n\nIn an interview in his small studio apartment in western Riga, old cigarette smoke in the air and Soviet\nmemorabilia adorning the walls, Mr. Alekseev echoed Kremlin views that Russia had intervened in\nUkraine only to suppress an armed conflict in the Donbas region where separatists in 2014 declared\nindependence.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\n\nHow will Russia's attack on Ukraine alter its relations with other Baltic nations? Join the conversation\nbelow.\n\n"For eight years there was a civil war, and Russia intervened," Mr. Alekseev said, feeding a piece of\nbanana to Irishka, his albino rat running across his desk. "This is called peacekeeping."\n\nSergey, the retired cartoonist, also appears unlikely to change his views.\n\nHe was born in Siberia in 1940 to parents who were both construction workers and came to Latvia in\n1950 to help rebuild a destroyed shipyard. Sergey has never become a Latvian citizen. "My parents\nand I worked to build this country," he said. "This is how they thank us."\n\nOver black coffee at his small kitchen table in a Soviet era housing block in western Riga, he said\nWestern media helped divide Latvia by stoking hatred of Mr. Putin.\n\n"If it's raining in London, Putin is to blame," he said.\n\nWrite to Sune Engel Rasmussen at sune.rasmussen@wsj.com\n\nPutin's War in Ukraine Tests Allegiances of Russian Speakers in Former Soviet Latvia\n</td>

      <td>\nKYIV, Ukraine—Russia and Ukraine prepared to hold cease-fire talks in Turkey to try to end more than\na month of war while intense fighting continued, with Ukrainian forces pressing to retake territory north\nof the capital Kyiv after Russian forces fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities overnight.\n</td>
      <td>\nRussian negotiators were due to arrive in Istanbul late on Monday, followed by a Ukrainian delegation\nduring the night, for cease-fire talks scheduled for Tuesday morning. Ukrainian President Volodymyr\nZelensky over the weekend outlined the conditions under which Ukraine might accept neutral status as\npart of a peace settlement with Russia, saying his country could hold a referendum on neutrality, but\nonly after Russian occupation forces leave Ukraine's territory.\n\nRead live updates on Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Kremlin said negotiations so far haven't yielded any breakthroughs, and Western officials have\nexpressed doubts about whether Russia is ready to halt hostilities in Ukraine.\n\nAt the White House on Monday, President Biden said his comment suggesting Russian President\nVladimir Putin shouldn't continue to hold power reflected moral outrage he was feeling, and he said it\ndidn't hurt attempts to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n"I'm not walking anything back," Mr. Biden said of his remarks on Saturday, in which he said of Mr.\nPutin: "For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power." The White House said shortly after he made\nthe comment that he wasn't calling for regime change.\n\n"I wasn't then nor am I now articulating a policy change," Mr. Biden said Monday. "I was expressing the\nmoral outrage that I feel and I make no apologies for it."\n\nEarlier this month, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who has become involved in attempts to end\nthe war, and Ukrainian peace negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in\nKyiv, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe Russian government previously has been accused of using poison to punish enemies. The\nKremlin has denied involvement in such attacks and didn't respond to a request for comment on\nMonday.\n\nUkrainian forces on Monday continued to counterattack Russian positions around Kyiv. Ukrainian\ntroops took back the strategically important town of Irpin, north of Kyiv, which fell under Russian control\nearlier this month, according to Irpin's mayor, Alexander Markushin. A senior U.S. official said Monday\nthat the U.S. couldn't independently verify that Irpin was back in Ukrainian hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian missiles struck Kyiv and the cities of Kharkiv, Lutsk, Rivne and Zhytomyr, according to\nUkrainian officials. Russian forces continued to try to push toward Kyiv from the east and northwest,\nattempting to control key roadways.\n\nUkraine's Emergencies Ministry said the strike on Lutsk hit fuel-storage facilities and authorities were\nstill trying to extinguish the blaze. The head of the provincial military administration, Yuriy Pohuliaiko,\nsaid the attack had been carried out with cruise missiles launched from neighboring Belarus. There\nwere no immediate details about casualties.\n\nRussian forces also appeared to push farther into Mariupol, a strategically important city linking\nRussian-controlled parts of the eastern Donbas region with territory Moscow has captured in the south.\n\nIn an interview with Russian journalists over the weekend, Mr. Zelensky said Ukraine could make a\nformal statement renouncing its aim of joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in return for\nbinding security guarantees from foreign partners.\n\nUkraine's neutrality would need to be ratified in a referendum, Mr. Zelensky said, since the country's\nconstitution currently sets out its aspirations to join NATO and the European Union.\n\nMr. Zelensky said Russian troops would have to withdraw from Ukrainian territory before a referendum\ncould be held, since a fair vote wasn't possible under foreign military occupation.\n\n"No one will ever recognize the results of a referendum if there are troops or illegal armed formations\non the territory of the country," he told the journalists.\n\nMr. Zelensky said that countries acting as guarantors of Ukraine's security would need to make legally\nbinding commitments that are ratified by their parliaments. He pointed to the 1994 Budapest\nmemorandum, in which Ukraine renounced nuclear weapons in return for security guarantees from\nRussia, the U.S. and the U.K., noting that Russia had invaded Ukraine anyway and Western countries\nhadn't prevented it.\n\nHe reiterated that Ukraine's government won't step down, nor accept demilitarization of the country,\nrejecting two of Russia's war aims.\n\nThe office of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he urged Mr. Putin in a phone call Sunday\nto accept a cease-fire with Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Western officials see few signs that Russia is willing to see a peaceful resolution to the\nconflict. "No one thinks there is the chance of a diplomatic solution in the next few days or even few\nweeks," said a senior European Union official.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that there had been no significant\nbreakthroughs in negotiations, and no progress on a potential meeting between the Russian and\nUkrainian presidents. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Monday that a meeting between the\ntwo presidents now would be counterproductive.\n\nAuthorities in Kyiv said they were bracing for renewed attacks by Russian forces. "They are preparing\nfor a major push, it is always like this ahead of big negotiations with Russians," said a Ukrainian official\nclose to the talks.\n\nThe official said the chances of success in cease-fire talks had grown in recent weeks, "from 10% two\nweeks ago to 50%."\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said over the weekend that, to his knowledge, there was a\ndiplomatic back channel between Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky.\n\n"I don't want to go into the details of this process. It seems that they have been negotiating serious\nissues, serious items," Mr. Cavusoglu said.\n\nBoth Russian and Ukrainian sides had explored several options regarding the venue and format for the\nnext round of talks, people close to the negotiations said, but agreed that Turkey would be the optimal\nlocation.\n\nAhead of Tuesday's talks, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said humanitarian\ncorridors for evacuating civilians wouldn't be open Monday after Ukrainian intelligence reported\npossible Russian attacks. Recent efforts have focused on evacuating civilians from the southeastern\ncities of Melitopol and Mariupol through Berdyansk and into Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\n\nSeveral minutes before Mr. Zelensky's interview was to be published by the Russian outlets, the\ncountry's communications censor issued a statement forbidding its publication. The interview was still\naccessible on the Latvia-based news website Meduza.\n\n"If there is such a reaction, it means we are doing everything right. They are nervous," Mr. Zelensky\nsaid in a speech on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nHe added that the cease-fire talks in Istanbul were important and that Ukraine was still pushing for the\nWest to impose further sanctions on Russia, including the blacklisting of all Russian public officials as\nwell as law-enforcement and military elites.\n\nUkraine is seeking to roll back Russian gains as Moscow shifts its focus to controlling a swath of the\ncountry's south and east.\n\nUkrainian forces said Sunday they drove Russian troops out of Trostyanets, in the northeast near the\nRussian border, potentially opening a road to the provincial capital of Sumy, which is encircled by the\nRussians.\n\nThe retaking of Trostyanets comes after Moscow, having faced stiff resistance from the Ukrainians in\nits initial, multifront offensive, said Friday that it would refocus its campaign on the Donbas region,\nwhere Russian forces hold a position of strength.\n\nIn the southeast of the country, Ukrainian troops blocked the Russian advance east of Zaporizhzhia\nand on positions north of Donetsk, according to the Ukrainian General Staff.\n\nIn the south, Ukrainian forces are concentrated on the defense of Kryvyi Rih and Mykolaiv.\n\nUkrainian air-defense systems repelled attacks in the Kyiv-area districts of Boryspil and Vasilkov,\naccording to a Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser. Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces had shot\ndown Ukrainian jets near the city of Chernihiv, north of Kyiv.\n\nRussia has continued making advances in Donbas, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen.\nIgor Konashenkov said Monday, claiming its forces had taken control of two villages.\n\nRussian forces have dug into defensive positions in the north and around Kyiv, which they have failed\nto seize. Russia's firepower is currently concentrated on Mariupol.\n\nWestern officials believe that Russia is now reinforcing in Donbas with fresh troops from the Wagner\nGroup, a Russian mercenary organization, with the goal of encircling Ukrainian forces.\n\nIt isn't clear how well trained these new Russian troops will be and whether they will have access to\nenough high-grade weaponry to make quick gains against battle-hardened Ukrainian troops there. The\nnew battalion tactical groups come from Russia's eastern military district, which experts say is the least\nbattle-trained and well equipped. However, refocusing the attack on a narrower front could solve some\nof the logistical problems that have dogged Russian forces and allow their dominant air power to assert\nitself.\n\nWestern officials estimate that as much as a fifth of the Russian force is no longer combat-effective and\nthat morale is low. But they warn that the war is far from won for Ukraine.\n\n"What we are not seeing is turning the tide, what we are seeing is some individual success," one\nofficial said. The creation of new Russian battalion tactical groups indicates that Mr. Putin is still going\n"all in," the official said.\n\nIsabel Coles and Jared Malsin contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com, Evan Gershkovich at evan.gershkovich@wsj.com\nand Brett Forrest at brett.forrest@wsj.com\n\nUkraine and Russia Prepare for Talks in Turkey as Russian Missiles Hit Cities\n</td>

      <td>\nThe White House requested an initial $773 billion budget for the Pentagon in fiscal 2023, up 4% from\nthe prior year and the starting point for discussions with Congress, elevated by the continuing war in\nUkraine.\n\nThe request, released Monday, continues the Pentagon's focus on what the White House called the\n"pacing" threat of China, which has rapidly expanded its military forces with more advanced weaponry.\n</td>
      <td>\nPentagon leaders on Monday called Russia a secondary "acute" threat, though the request was\nfinalized before Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month and allocated just $300 million in military\nsupport, on top of the $3.6 billion recently agreed by Congress.\n\nThe Biden administration's military budget request focuses on development of new weapons systems,\nespecially refreshing America's arsenal of long-range nuclear missiles delivered from bombers,\nland-based silos and submarines.\n\nThe request will be sent to Congress, which typically changes the amounts spent on individual\nweapons systems, such as the F-35 combat jet made by Lockheed Martin Corp. Analysts said they\ndon't expect a final budget to be approved before the midterm elections in November.\n\nThe overall request for military spending of $813 billion, which includes departments outside the\nPentagon, is also up 4% from the prior year. However, inflation left the budget request up just 1.5% in\nreal terms from funding in the 2022 budget, Pentagon Comptroller Mike McCord said at a briefing.\n\nThe U.S. spends more by far on defense than any other country, with watchdogs such as the Project on\nGovernment Oversight estimating an annual budget of over $1 trillion on national security. That\nestimate includes the Department of Veterans Affairs and the cost of servicing debt from previous\ndefense spending.\n\nShares in military contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman Corp. have been\ntrading around all-time highs in recent weeks. Analysts attributed the gains to investor expectations of\nhigher global military spending following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, especially among European\ngovernments such as Germany.\n\nNorthrop Grumman is developing a new U.S. bomber and intercontinental ballistic missiles, while\nGeneral Dynamics Corp. is building new submarines. Planned U.S. purchases of Lockheed Martin F-35\ncombat jets were trimmed from recent years, while Boeing-made fighters and refueling tankers secured\nmore funding.\n\nBoeing in recent years lost out to Northrop Grumman on deals to build the B-21 long-range bomber and\nnew nuclear missiles. On Monday, Boeing said Leanne Caret would step down in April as head of its\ndefense business, succeeded by Ted Colbert, who currently leads its services unit.\n\n\nShares in Lockheed Martin settled 1.9% lower Monday, while Northrop Grumman fell 2.5%. Boeing and\nRaytheon Technologies Corp., which have large commercial aerospace businesses as well as defense,\nhad smaller declines on Monday.\n\nThe Air Force and the Navy received the biggest increases in proposed funding.\n\nThe increase over the recently enacted military-funding bill for fiscal 2022 doubles the pace of the\nWhite House request for last year. Defense stocks underperformed the broader market in 2021 after\ncompanies forecast a flat or shrinking budget this year in real terms, when inflation was taken into\naccount.\n\nSpending on procurement in the new request is little changed from last year, but the Pentagon's Mr.\nMcCord said more could be allocated to support Ukraine and European allies. There is more planned\nspending on research into new weapons and systems, especially in space.\n\nThe budget also has to cover inflation-driven increases in pay—including a 4.6% rise for the\ndepartment's civilian and military personnel next year—and materials such as fuel. Inflation is forecast\nat around 2% in the next fiscal year, though Mr. McCord said this would be revisited closer to the\nbudget's start on Oct. 1.\n\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n\nPentagon Seeks Higher Military Spending to Keep Pace With China, Russia\n</td>

      <td>\nAt what point does Joe Biden's verbal incontinence start to become a mortal threat to Americans?\n\nUntil now we've mostly had the luxury of observing the president's many rhetorical infelicities with a\nmixture of mild puzzlement and gentle concern, as one might watch an aging relative struggle to\nremember the name of one's children.\n</td>
      <td>\nBut some words have larger consequences than others—especially when you're the president of the\nUnited States. It's one thing to misidentify your vice president as the first lady, quite another to call for\nthe ouster of an autocratic and bellicose leader of a nation with nuclear weapons. That is the kind of\nthing that can trigger wars that could result in the annihilation of much of humanity.\n\nIt's a sign of the rising alarm the presidential blunders must be causing in diplomatic circles that the\nWhite House communications shop has stopped attempting to correct the gaffes that come flying like\ngrapeshot from a cannon. Instead they take the Humpty Dumpty approach. Instead of issuing\ncorrections or clarifications of Mr. Biden's words, they simply invoke Humpty's philosophy on the\npresident's behalf: "Whenever I use a word . . . it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more\nnor less."\n\nThis exercise in through-the-looking-glass semantics was on display last week throughout the\npresident's trip to Europe, where he sought to rally allies in support of Ukraine and against Russian\naggression.\n\nAt North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Brussels on Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked what\nthe U.S. would do if Vladimir Putin used chemical weapons in Ukraine. He said the West would respond\n"in kind." You might think, deploying commonly understood definitions, that he meant to convey the\nsomewhat shocking threat that NATO would retaliate against use of a weapon of mass destruction with\na like attack. But you'd be wrong. Later, Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, said\nthat while Russia would pay a heavy price if it used such weapons, the U.S. had "no intention of using\nchemical weapons, period, under any circumstances."\n\nThe next day in Poland, the president casually remarked to American troops stationed there that some\nof them had already been in Ukraine and others would be going soon. Soon another administration\nHumpty was on the line to reporters, insisting that Mr. Biden's words were in no way inconsistent with\nthe fact that the U.S. had no forces in Ukraine and no plans to send any.\n\nOn Saturday we had the most arresting breach between presidential words and improvised official\ndefinitions. At the end of an impassioned speech that denounced Vladimir Putin's aggression and\nframed the struggle as a battle between democracy and tyranny, Mr. Biden threw down a gauntlet: "For\nGod's sake, this man cannot remain in power."\n\nThis apparent call for regime change in Moscow, was, we were instantly told, nothing of the sort. "The\npresident's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,"\n\naccording to an unnamed White House official. "He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia, or\nregime change."\n\nWe can't go on like this. Credibility is essential to the effective and safe conduct of national security. No\namount of hasty cleanup will erase the words that come from the lips of a commander in chief. And no,\nit is not a defense of the president to note—accurately—that his immediate predecessor was as\nnotorious for his verbal indiscipline as Mr. Biden is.\n\nFor now, we have an immediate and escalating problem with this presidency. We can certainly hope\nthat Russians understand as well as we do that, at 79, Mr. Biden is prone to saying things he doesn't\nmean. But we can't be sure. What we can be sure of is that Mr. Putin, who has already whipped up his\ncompatriots into a frenzy of paranoia about the "real" intentions of the U.S. in arming Ukraine—to wit, an\nattempt to weaken and destroy Russia itself—will seize on every piece of evidence he can find to\nbolster his case.\n\nDiplomacy is a subtle activity that combines artful deception with necessary candor. States convey to\neach other only what they want or need to convey; they willfully mislead each other about some aspects\nof their objectives and capabilities while drawing bright red lines around their nonnegotiable truths.\nStrategic ambiguity helps induce in allies and adversaries alike a distinct uncertainty about intentions.\nBut clarity is essential when the stakes are existential. Decoding these complex messages, sifting the\nsignal from the noise, is the essence of successful statecraft.\n\nMr. Biden's penchant for reckless language simply bludgeons through this delicate diplomatic\ninfrastructure. It compromises the ability of the U.S. and its allies to achieve our objectives, while\nsignificantly increasing the risk of a miscalculation on either side.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy said that during World War II, Winston Churchill "mobilized the English language and\nsent it into battle." Mr. Biden seems intent on doing the same—only he may be sending it into battle on\nthe wrong side.\n\nBiden at the Improv: Ukraine and the Dangers of Foreign Policy by Open Mic\n</td>

      <td>\nThe Biden administration has been vocal in defending what it calls the "rules-based\ninternational order," but there is no such thing. An Earth-spanning security space governed by\nglobal rules or a few key powers doesn't exist, as the war in Ukraine should remind us. There\nis also no "global threat" facing all states equally but, rather, regional revisionist powers\nthreatening nearby states. Temporary regional equilibria with their own power dynamics are\ndriven by local historical competitions. They are unstable and prone to wars. They require\npersistent attention and management.\n\nOver the past three decades these regional orders—in Europe, the Middle East and\nAsia—have been relatively stable and the local competitions subdued. The resulting\nimpression was of a world order. Liberals saw this global stability as the product of international\nrules, a growing number of democracies, and greater international trade—a "rules-based\norder" enhanced by democracies and commercial peace. Realists saw a world order\nunderwritten by a rough equilibrium between the great powers—the U.S., Russia and\nChina—with nuclear weapons as an effective pacifying equalizer.\n\nBoth visions of world order put too much emphasis on the global nature of this stability. If we\nlook at the world through the lens of regional orders, the picture is more worrisome.\n\nRussia's wars in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since 2014, as well as Iran's actions in Iraq,\nYemen and Syria, and China's military expansion in Asia, were signs of growing local volatility.\nBut until now these had been tentative pushes, conducted by hesitant revisionist powers and\nchecked by American power. Russia's war in Ukraine is the first full-fledged military offensive\nthat aims to change the local balance of power drastically. Russia seeks to be the decisive\npower in Europe, and for that it needs to dominate Ukraine.\n\nRegional orders are fragile for two reasons. First, military force is more likely to be used in local\ncontests than in disputes between distant rivals. The stakes are high for the local parties, the\nperceived risks limited. A revisionist power is likely to pursue its goals, such as conquest of\nterritory or control over a neighboring state's political life, through war more than through\n\nnegotiations. And the revisionist power's targets won't accept a hostile takeover without a fight.\nIn the end, both sides are interested less in preventing war than in making war usable for their\nown objectives. War is an enduring regional reality.\n\nThe U.S. tends to think of stability as a broad goal of its grand strategy. As President Biden has\nsaid, the goal is to "strive to prevent" World War III. But regional revisionists in Eurasia aren't\nafraid of putting pressure on their own frontiers to extend their influence. The states they\nthreaten will also choose war over submission, regional disorder over lost independence. The\nU.S. will have to figure out how to navigate, even embrace, instability and war in regions that\nare important to its national interests.\n\nThe second reason regional orders are unstable is that local contests are geographically\nlimited but last a long time. Local conflicts are based on, or justified by, historical claims.\nPerceived or real offenses committed in the past generate desires for revenge; aspirations to\ngrandeur spur territorial demands; and national self-confidence motivates a stubborn hostility to\naggressive neighbors. When the roots of a political action lie in national claims to greatness,\ndiplomatic compromise becomes difficult. Lengthy conflict begins to look preferable to a\nnegotiated settlement. It is more legitimate to dig trenches than to sit at negotiating tables.\n\nLocal antagonists are willing to incur high costs both when attacking (like Russia) and when\ndefending (like Ukraine). The expectation is that the high risk will be rewarded with a high\npayoff: The aggressor anticipates greater influence or a larger territory, while the defender\nexpects independence and greater security.\n\nFor a distant power such as the U.S., the enduring nature of regional conflicts in Eurasia is a\npolitical challenge. Managing such conflicts requires consistent involvement and a permanent\npresence. But the U.S. approach is to participate in regional geopolitical dynamics only when\nnecessary to restore an equipoise, and then to move to a different region. Thus we hear talk of\n"uniting" Europe and "pivoting" to Asia.\n\nIt is historically rare for a local contest to come to a permanent end—usually only when a\ndevastating war redraws the map in blood. The Franco-German conflict of the 19th and early\n20th centuries turned into friendship only after two gruesome world wars. The end result was\ngood for Europe, but getting there was tragic and something to be avoided.\n\nThe current war between Russia and Ukraine will end at some point, but the contest between\nthe two nations won't. The best that can be hoped for is a delicate local equilibrium demanding\nconstant maintenance through Western economic and military support of Ukraine.\n\nIf Ukraine survives Russian aggression as an independent state, the Biden administration's\nliberal temptation will be to call it a victory for world order based on rules and democracies.\nThat would be a mistake. The victory will be Ukraine's, resulting in a moment of fragile regional\nstability and not in a renewed world order.\n\nMr. Grygiel is a professor at the Catholic University of America, a senior fellow at the Marathon\nInitiative, and a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.\n\nUkraine War Shows the 'Rules-Based International Order' Is a Myth\n</td>

      <td>\nVladimir Putin hoped to break up the European status quo with his attack on Ukraine. Increasingly, it\nappears that the chief consequence will be to reinforce it. President Biden may have gaffed his way\nacross Europe last week, but Mr. Putin's unhinged behavior has removed any doubts European policy\nmakers may have had about the value of the trans-Atlantic alliance. Worse for Russia, Mr. Putin's war is\nmaking Germany more powerful, more activist and more Atlanticist, a combination likely to support\nAmerican power and undercut Russian influence in Europe for many years to come.\n</td>
      <td>\nTo describe Germany as a winner in Mr. Putin's war against Ukraine would go too far. The war upended\nthe assumptions on which German energy and security policy has long rested and forced Germany to\nmake harsh decisions it preferred to avoid. Angela Merkel's Germany dreamed that its companies could\nprosper indefinitely while a great green energy transition rippled painlessly through an\never-democratizing, ever-disarming world. Thanks to the war, German business is reassessing its\nrelations with China as well as Russia. The military plans spending increases, and energy policy is\nshifting from "climate first" to "security first" to reduce dependence on Russian imports.\n\nThe consequences of these changes for Germany's place in Europe and Europe's role in the world will\nbe profound. Assuming Berlin follows through with its pledge to raise defense spending to 2% of gross\ndomestic product, Germany is on course to become the military as well as economic powerhouse of the\nEuropean Union. France will remain the only nuclear-armed EU member and will likely remain better\nplaced to engage outside the EU than Germany, but Berlin's growing conventional military power will\ninevitably tip the balance further toward Germany in the internal politics of the EU.\n\nThere is more. Managing a massive refugee program, supporting Ukraine economically in the wake of a\ndevastating war, and building up the strength of frontline states are generational tasks that will engage\nEuropean policy makers and soak up European economic resources for years. The EU expansion\nprocess had ground to a halt in recent years as some member countries fretted over the cost of\nincluding new members and others worried that a growing membership could make it harder to reach\ntimely decisions and limit the prospects for a deeper and stronger union. Those concerns remain, but\nthe need to promote economic and political stability on the EU's eastern flank will likely make the case\nfor expansion harder to resist as more EU money flows east.\n\nAll this makes Germany's role as the EU's central powerbroker—balancing the conflicting agendas of the\nFrugal North, the Endangered East and the Indebted South—more crucial to Europe's future than ever.\nThis will likely be good news for American strategists who have long hesitated between two scenarios\nfor Europe's future. On one hand, almost everyone in the world of American foreign policy wants Europe\nto become stronger militarily, as that would help stabilize the region while reducing the cost to the U.S.\nof European security. On the other hand, a Europe so powerful that it would no longer need American\nprotection might become a political and economic rival in ways that Americans would not always\nwelcome. The German awakening suggests that we are about to see a Europe that is both stronger and\nless Gaullist than most thought possible before Mr. Putin's invasion.\n\n\n\nGermany's attitudes about European independence and American power are complex. Germans do not\nalways see the world as Americans do, and the election of Donald Trump significantly reinforced\nGerman skepticism about American reliability and strategic competence. But strong trans-Atlantic ties\nhelp solidify Germany's place in Europe. The American military presence in Europe calms countries like\nPoland that might otherwise fear a rearming Germany even as the NATO security guarantee provides\nmuch more confidence than EU security guarantees alone ever could.\n\nGermany won't, however, turn its back on Brussels or Paris. For both economic and security reasons,\nGermany needs the EU, and the commitment to a deep relationship with France remains embedded in\nGerman political culture and strategic thought. Berlin will deepen defense cooperation with Paris even\nas it bolsters its Atlantic ties. Presumably one aspect of this will be that much of its new defense budget\nultimately will involve joint ventures with French and other European weapons makers.\n\nMr. Putin wanted a weaker Europe, increasingly separated from the U.S. It looks as if he's going to get\nexactly the opposite. Mr. Putin's war, so far at least, looks set to promote the emergence of a Europe\nthat is militarily stronger and more deeply engaged with the U.S. than at any time since the end of the\nCold War.\n\nRussia's War With Ukraine Unifies Europe\n</td>

Oil prices remain sharply higher since Russia invaded Ukraine in February,\nas Western sanctions and boycotts against Russia have effectively cut world-wide supply. Brent crude,\nthe global price benchmark, dropped about 6.8% to $112.48.\n</td>
      <td>\nChina's aggressive approach to containing Covid-19 is likely to dent the country's demand for oil,\nanalysts at Commerzbank wrote in a Monday note to clients, after rising cases sent half of Shanghai\ninto lockdown. Public-transit lines were suspended and some manufacturers paused operations. Tesla\nInc. said it would close production there for four days.\n\n"There was some hope that China this time around would not go through a lockdown, but the message\nfrom the country is that that's out of the question," said Natasha Kaneva, J.P. Morgan's head of global\ncommodities research. "I think the market is definitely afraid of what is coming next."\n\nA reduction in demand from China could ease pressure on global markets after prices surged to\nmultiyear highs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Traders, banks, insurers and shipping\ncompanies have shunned Russian oil and shortfalls have begun hitting the market, with many\npredicting more ahead. The rise in prices has translated into more expensive gasoline—now averaging\nover $4.20 a gallon in the U.S. according to AAA—denting consumers' wallets and contributing to\npersistent inflation.\n\nWestern drillers such as BP PLC and Shell PLC have pulled out of Russia, as have companies\nincluding Halliburton Co. and Baker Hughes Co. that provide technical services in oil fields. Russia's\nexporters have turned to selling crude at steep discounts in off-market transactions that allow buyers to\nshield their identities from the stigma of trading with Russian firms.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. oil producers face bottlenecks hampering their ability to respond to higher prices by\nexpanding their output. Ramping up drilling takes time—especially after many domestic drillers already\ntapped a large portion of their ready-to-go wells as fuel demand recovered since the start of the\npandemic. Disappointing returns on oil drilling during the 2010s have also reduced investors' appetite\nfor big capital outlays to expand production.\n\nInvestors will look for more clarity on the supply outlook from Thursday's meeting of the Organization of\nthe Petroleum Exporting Countries. The group of oil-rich states will most likely modestly increase\nsupply in accordance with its long-term plan, without adjusting to make up for the fall in Russian\nexports, analysts at Ritterbusch &amp; Associates wrote.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Howell, a portfolio manager at Gresham Investment Management, said his fund has kept a\nrelatively neutral stance on oil recently, but is looking for opportunities to sell.\n\n"This is a bull market that has traveled a long way very quickly and it may now be on borrowed time,"\nhe said.\n\nWrite to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com\n\nOil Prices Fall as Lockdowns in China Weigh on Demand\n</td>

      <td>\nIn the hours after three journalists working for Fox News in Ukraine took fire on March 14, staffers from\nrival news organization CNN stepped up to assist the cable network.\n\nClarissa Ward, chief international correspondent for CNN, and Trey Yingst, a foreign correspondent for\nFox News, worked in CNN's makeshift newsroom in a Kyiv hotel suite, calling morgues and hospitals to\ntrack down Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and Oleksandra "Sasha" Kuvshynova, a\nconsultant for the network, according to people familiar with the situation.\n</td>
      <td>\nMs. Ward and Mr. Yingst called Ukrainian military officials and passed along information about their last\nknown whereabouts, the people said. Security personnel from NBC and Sky News also offered to help\nFox News during that period, they said. Later, Fox News's security team received a tip that their\nremains had been located, some of the people said.\n\nA third Fox News journalist, foreign-affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall, survived and had already\nbeen taken to the hospital with severe injuries.\n\nThe tragedy underscored the tremendous risks journalists face in covering Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\na conflict that has resulted in the deaths of five media workers in the past month, according to the\nCommittee to Protect Journalists. The event also demonstrated the teamwork and coordination among\nnews organizations with staffers on the ground.\n\nSuch coordination is common in war zones, but the Ukraine conflict has exposed news organizations to\ndifferent types of threats compared to some other conflicts of recent years. The security risks for\njournalists in Afghanistan and Iraq were also severe—among them, the threat of improvised explosive\ndevices, kidnappings or suicide bombers. In Ukraine, there is a heightened concern about missiles and\nartillery fire raining down on civilian areas, news executives and security experts said.\n\n"Here, death comes out of the sky indiscriminately," said a head of global newsgathering at a large\nU.S.-based news network.\n\nDavid Rohde, a former New York Times reporter who was kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan in\n2008 while working on a book, said in an interview that the information shared among news\norganizations helps journalists in the country avoid danger.\n\n"We should compete aggressively against each other in terms of stories but shouldn't compete when it\ncomes to safety," said Mr. Rohde, who is now executive editor for news at the New Yorker's website.\n\nIn the event a journalist is injured or killed, the U.S. military doesn't have a presence in Ukraine to offer\nhelp. In the case of Mr. Hall, Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin worked with an\norganization called Save Our Allies to transport the injured journalist and get him access to medical\ncare, Fox News has reported.\n\n\nMr. Hall was evacuated to Poland and was eventually transported back to the U.S.\n\nElena Cosentino, the director of the International News Safety Institute, which supports outlets covering\nhazardous situations, said she began organizing daily safety calls in the weeks before the war with\nnews executives from organizations including the Associated Press, Reuters, Agence France-Presse\nand Dow Jones &amp; Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal. The frequency of the calls and amount\nof information being shared—regarding safe travel routes, hard-to-navigate military checkpoints and\naccess to supplies—is unprecedented, she said.\n\n"Ultimately, the aim is to raise the bar for safety and have the best mitigations in place while doing the\nbest-possible journalism," Ms. Cosentino said.\n\nThe Associated Press and other news outlets, including Reuters, are sharing information that can help\nthem shape individual decisions, such as about where to send correspondents, according to people\nfamiliar with the matter. Some news organizations are teaming up to identify ways to evacuate their\npersonnel, secure lodging and transport journalists into the country. Recently, outlets with\ncorrespondents on the ground began exploring ways to handle medical emergencies together, one of\nthe people said.\n\nJournalists are also facing risks on the other side of the Ukrainian border. Early this month, Russia\npassed a law that threatens as much as 15 years of prison time for anyone publishing what authorities\nconsider to be false information about the country's invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin refers to as\na special military operation.\n\nA number of news outlets, including CNN and Bloomberg News, suspended the work of their journalists\nin the country. New York Times Co. also decided to pull its editorial staff from Russia, and the\nWashington Post at the time said it would remove bylines from articles reported in Russia. Dow Jones\nsaid in a statement that being in Moscow is key to its mission of covering the Ukraine-Russia story.\n\nAfter news organizations communicated their plans in response to the new law, Russia's Ministry of\nForeign Affairs summoned several correspondents to discuss the matter, according to people familiar\nwith the situation. In the meeting, a Russian official grilled some correspondents about their justification\nfor being in Russia, with their companies' operations suspended, one of the people said. Russia's\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs didn't respond to a request for comment about the meeting.\n\n"There were challenges living and working as a journalist in Russia, but this new law essentially made it\nimpossible by criminalizing independent fact-based reporting," said Michael Slackman, assistant\nmanaging editor for international at the Times.\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corp. suspended its broadcasts from Russia and sought legal advice from\nspecialists, including lawyers based in Russia, said Richard Burgess, interim head of news content for\nBBC News. Days later, the BBC said its correspondents could resume reporting in English from Russia,\nas long as they used specific language that complied with the BBC's interpretation of the law. Instead of\ncalling the invasion of Ukraine a war, for example, BBC News Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg uses\nlanguage such as, "what the Kremlin refuses to call the war," said Mr. Burgess.\n\n"Nobody knows definitively the way that the Russian government will interpret this new law, but we\nmade a judgment call," he said.\n\nThe level of risk was too great to continue coverage in Russian, he said.\n\nBBC World News coverage that aired in English in Russia was banned, and BBC News websites were\nblocked in Russian and English, said a BBC spokeswoman. To distribute its news content, the BBC\nlaunched an account on TikTok in Russian and English and has been broadcasting over shortwave\nradio in Ukraine and parts of Russia to locals, said Mr. Burgess.\n\n"We are doing what we can to get news to people," he said.\n\nAnn M.

      <td>\nWASHINGTON—Up to a dozen developing countries face increased risk of debt defaults in the coming\nyear as the war in Ukraine boosts commodity prices and adds to existing Covid-19 pandemic-related\npressures, a top World Bank economist said.\n\nEven before Russia invaded Ukraine, highly indebted emerging and developing economies were on\nshaky ground, said Marcello Estevao, the World Bank's global director for macroeconomics, trade and\ninvestment, in a blog post on Monday. The pandemic had pushed up total indebtedness of the\ncountries to a 50-year high, or the equivalent of more than 2.5 times government revenues.\n</td>
      <td>\n"The Ukraine war immediately darkened the outlook for many developing countries that are major\ncommodity importers or highly dependent on tourism or remittances," he said, adding that the world\ncould experience the "largest spate of debt crises in developing economies in a generation."\n\nWhile Mr. Estevao didn't mention specific countries at risk, economists say countries that rely heavily\non wheat imports, particularly those in Africa and the Middle East, face severe risks of economic\nhardship and social instability because of sharp increases in prices of wheat, a major export product of\nUkraine and Russia.\n\nEgypt, the world's largest importer of wheat, has already felt economic stress from the war. Last week,\nit sought financial support from the International Monetary Fund.\n\n"The rapidly changing global environment and spillovers related to the war in Ukraine are posing\nimportant challenges for countries around the world, including Egypt," said Celine Allard, the IMF's\nmission chief for Egypt.\n\nSri Lanka, struggling with more than $20 billion in debts owed to international bondholders, separately\nsaid it would seek IMF financial help.\n\nThe finances in some emerging economies were already deteriorating as rising interest rates, prompted\nby the U.S. Federal Reserve plans to tighten monetary policy, pushed up debt-servicing costs.\n\nInterest rates on debt by African countries have already risen relative to rates for U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, according to Capital Economics, a London research firm, with Ghana and Ethiopia\nexperiencing the widest spreads.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group of 20 major economies set up an initiative to allow\ndeveloping countries to suspend debt servicing through a $13 billion fund available to nearly 50\ncountries.\n\nAfter that program expired at the end of 2021 the G-20 established another framework on restructuring\nof debts. Three countries have applied but progress has been slow.\n\n\n\n"It can be and must be improved in time to provide meaningful relief to countries that need it," Mr.\nEstevao said.\n\nMr. Estevao said crises could develop rapidly once they start, though he ruled out the possibility of a\nglobal crisis similar to the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s. That is because much of the\nsovereign debt is owed to private-sector creditors, rather than the governments of richer countries, with\nvariable interest rates that react immediately to rises in global interest rates.\n\n"The main global mechanisms available today to tackle debt crises weren't designed for these\nconditions," he wrote. "They must be updated."\n\nWrite to Yuka Hayashi at yuka.hayashi@wsj.com\n\nUkraine War Increases Risk of Debt Defaults by Developing Countries\n</td>

      <td>\nFinance chiefs at Western companies that continue to operate and sell products in Russia have to\ndecide what to do with the profits generated from those businesses.\n\nA month into the war, several companies have said they will donate profits derived from Russia to aid\nhumanitarian-relief efforts in Ukraine, while others continue to book those profits as part of their global\nearnings.\n</td>
      <td>\nSuch considerations are likely to become pressing questions ahead of the quarterly close at the end of\nthis month as these measures will likely face scrutiny from shareholders and outside stakeholders. The\nwar also has exposed how many global companies—both large and small—have business ties to\nRussia.\n\n"This is something that each company needs to decide," said Amit Khandelwal, a professor for global\nbusiness at Columbia Business School, referring to the question around Russian profits. "A company\nhas obligations to its employees—both Russian and non-Russian—shareholders and customers," he\nsaid.\n\nA roster of international companies, including Bayer AG, Nestlé SA, Danone SA, Kimberly-Clark Corp.,\nUnilever PLC and PepsiCo Inc. say they keep selling in Russia to provide essential supplies, including\ncancer medication, baby food and diapers. Also among those products are potato chips, laundry\ndetergent and air fresheners.\n\nNestlé said it is limiting products sold in the country to baby food, specialist veterinary meals and other\nnutrition products, adding it would donate any profit to humanitarian-relief organizations. The company\nsaid it doesn't know yet how it will report these donations to investors.\n\nConsumer-goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which continues to sell products in Russia, said it is\ndonating money and products to aid Ukrainians. A spokesman, when asked about the company's plan\nfor profits from Russia, said, "We don't disclose or discuss profits by business unit (geographical or\nproduct line)."\n\nPharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. will continue to supply medication to Russia but will donate all profit to\nsupport Ukraine's relief efforts, Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said. "Maintaining the supply of\nmedicines to Russia does not mean we will continue doing business as usual in Russia," the company\nsaid.\n\nUnilever, PepsiCo and Kimberly-Clark didn't respond to requests for comment, while Bayer pointed to\nan existing statement that doesn't mention its profits from Russia. Danone said it isn't taking any cash,\ndividends or profits out of its business in Russia and that any profits made locally would be directed to\nhumanitarian aid. AstraZeneca PLC declined to comment on what it plans to do with profits from its\nmedication sales in Russia.\n\nSome businesses said they have ring-fenced their Russian operations, meaning that proceeds won't\nflow into global profit-and-loss statements. Dutch brewer Heineken NV earlier this month said it would\nno longer accept any net financial benefit from its Russian operations and would stop the flow of\nroyalties and dividends out of Russia. The company on Monday said it would transfer its Russian\nbusiness to a new owner without disclosing more details. Heineken said operations will continue during\nthe transition period.\n\nOther companies may find it harder to give up revenue and profits generated in Russia, especially if\nthey have large business interests in the country.\n\nMetro AG, a German wholesaler that generated about €2.4 billion in sales—equivalent to $2.64\nbillion—or 10% of its total revenue from its Russian business during the latest fiscal year, said it will\ncontinue its operations there. The company declined to comment on whether it would consider\ndonating the profits generated in Russia. "Salaries and bills are processed by well-established\ninternational banks that aren't subject to sanctions," a spokesman said.\n\nA few companies say they don't break down revenue and profit by geography and that it would be\nchallenging to separate profit derived from sales in Russia.\n\nA German agricultural-equipment maker that asked not to be named said all of its revenue flows into\none pot, including sales in Russia. The company continues to sell machine parts to its Russian\ncustomers, with German custom authorities reviewing every shipment.\n\nThe company is transferring Russian revenue to Germany "as quickly as possible," a person familiar\nwith the transactions said. Despite the extensive Western sanctions against Russia, some\nfinancial-transaction lines remain open, allowing companies to transfer funds out of the country,\nlawyers said.\n\nThe depreciation of the ruble—which has declined more than 20% against the dollar since Feb.\n24—and other currencies has made the decision easier for some companies that say it isn't worth the\neffort or the reputational risk to keep booking profits from Russia.\n\nLush Ltd., the Poole, England-based maker of soaps, said will continue to sell in Russia until its\nsupplies run out and plans to keep any revenue or profit from those sales in the country to pay\nemployees. "The decline in the ruble has made these decisions easier for companies," Chief Executive\nOfficer Mark Constantine said.\n\nInvestors likely will hear more about how companies treat their Russian profits in the coming weeks,\nbut responses will be determined in some part by factors outside of the profit-and-loss statement.\n\n"It very much depends on the sector a company is active in, how large the business in Russia is\ncompared to the rest, its attitude and whether the company is being scrutinized by the media," said\nRichard Wellmann, a partner at audit firm BDO who leads the company's Russia desk in Germany.\n\nSaabira Chaudhury and Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com\n\nTrentmann's Take: CFOs Adopt Different Approaches to Profits Made in Russia\n</td>

      <td>\nUSTRONIE MORSKIE, Poland -- Olena Sirotiuk was on the night train moving east toward the\nfront lines in Ukraine when she got a call from her 12-year-old son. "Don't come Mummy," he\nsaid. "They're shooting."\n\nMs. Sirotiuk, a cleaner living in western Poland, was one of the few women on a train packed\nwith men headed back to fight the Russians. She wanted to retrieve her son, Nazariy, from\nbehind what had suddenly become enemy territory.\n</td>
      <td>\n"You go because your child is there," said Ms. Sirotiuk, 50. "In that moment, there is no fear."\n\nThe lights on the train were turned off to avoid alerting Russian army patrols, Ms. Sirotiuk later\nrecalled. Instead, the corridors were illuminated by the glow of cellphone screens detailing news\nabout the war and messages from relatives stuck in bomb shelters or negotiating their way to\nsafety abroad. The train trundled along at about 30 miles an hour, and slowed more when\nartillery fire or shelling could be heard.\n\nIt was the start of what would be a five-day, 2,100-mile journey for Ms. Sirotiuk to the industrial\ncity of Zaporizhzhia and back, by light rail and bus from Gryfino, on Poland's border with\nGermany, to Lviv, in Ukraine's west, and then by train deep into areas pummeled by advancing\nRussian forces.\n\nSince Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion on Feb. 24, around 3.8 million\npeople have fled, prompting what the United Nations has called the fastest and largest\ndisplacement in Europe since World War II. A significant number are going the other way.\nAmong them are mothers trying to save their children.\n\nThe government of President Volodymyr Zelensky has banned men aged 18 to 60 from leaving\nUkraine to help fend off Russia's full-scale assault. Ukraine's State Border Guard Service said\nmore than 317,000 Ukrainians have returned to the country since Russia invaded, mostly men\ngoing to fight.\n\nMs. Sirotiuk had no plan. Her own mother, who had been caring for her son while she worked in\nPoland, said the trip, four days into the war, was too risky, and warned her it wouldn't work out.\nWait in Poland until things calm down, she said: "Nazariy is relatively safe with us."\n\nIn one of the train's middle carriages, Ms. Sirotiuk sat in the darkness by the window with her\nhands folded over the backpack placed on her knees, and thought about Nazariy, a boy who\nnever sat still. Like the majority of Ukrainians, Ms. Sirotiuk dismissed warnings in Western\nmedia that Mr. Putin was preparing to attack. "We had gotten used to Putin's crazy statements\nabout Ukraine," she said. "But until the last moment, no one believed this could happen."\n\nAs she traveled closer, Nazariy got busy packing his things. He said he found a large bag and\nplaced his documents, clothes and toys in it, including his beloved computer, ending up with\nsomething weighing around 45 pounds.\n\n\n"I felt happy, because she was coming," he said later. "But I also felt scared for my mum."\n\nMs. Sirotiuk moved to Poland in October 2019 after the death of her second husband, Nazariy's\nfather. She was part of a wave of Ukrainians who immigrated to the EU member state after the\n2014 conflict with Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. Now she lives in Ustronie Morskie,\nin northwestern Poland, and cleans guesthouses there and in the neighboring town of Gryfino\nand across the border in Germany. During time off she trains to be a nurse.\n\nHer son, her third and youngest child, lived with her in Poland for half a year. He temporarily\nmoved back to Ukraine to live with his grandparents, but had been wanting to return to Poland\nto be with his mother. Ms. Sirotiuk has two adult children who have remained in Ukraine, her\nson to fight and her daughter to be with her husband.\n\nMs. Sirotiuk was on the phone with Nazariy after the war started when he witnessed Russian\ntanks, she said. Her worries about her son's safety quickly mounted. Ms. Sirotiuk's parents live\naround 12 miles from Enerhodar, home to a vast nuclear power station that Russian forces\nwould begin shelling seven days into the war. An administrative building directly beside the\nreactor complex would be hit, prompting urgent calls for a cease-fire from the International\nAtomic Energy Agency. "It was a close call," the agency director Mariano Grossi would later\nsay.\n\nRussia ultimately took control of Enerhodar, ending the fighting but prompting rallies by\nresidents shouting "Go home!" at the troops. In towns taken over in Ukraine's south, soldiers\nwho had been led to believe they would be met with cheers instead faced angry crowds.\n\nMs. Sirotiuk reached Zaporizhzhia on the morning of March 1, having slept for several hours on\na hard bunk in the train using her backpack as a makeshift pillow.\n\n"Everything will be fine," she told her son in a text message. "I love you."\n\n"I also love you very very very very much," he replied.\n\nA few hours later -- "Mum they blew up a bridge yesterday in Ivanivka," a town 5 miles from his\nhome.\n\nZaporizhzhia is a two-hour drive from her parents' village near the nuclear power plant. The\nroad she would have to use -- there and back -- skirts the Dnipro River and passes through\ntowns under heavy assault from Russian forces.\n\nShe spent the day frantically calling taxi companies and searching for bus and cabdrivers who\nmight go get her son or bring her to him, but none were willing to make the journey.\n\nOne man ultimately agreed and asked about $100 in payment. She gave him the money, the\nlion's share of the cash she had with her, and never saw him again. He switched off his phone\nand stopped responding to her calls.\n\n"I sat at the train station and waited for him the entire day," she said.\n\nHer mother would check in with her constantly, trying to persuade her to leave. On a phone call\ntoward the evening, she heard the sound of air-raid sirens in Zaporizhzhia and screamed at her\ndaughter.\n\n"Leave, Olena! God forbid they fire on Zaporizhzhia and kill you too," Ms. Sirotiuk recalled.\n\nAt the train station, she overheard two Ukrainian soldiers who had just bid farewell to their wives\nand children. They were talking about intense fighting around Vasylivka, a town she would need\nto pass through to collect her son.\n\nIt was in that moment that she decided to leave.\n\nShe traveled back toward Poland on a carriage full of fleeing mothers and children. "All I\nremember from the train trip was the never-ending sound of a crying infant," she said.\n\nWhen Nazariy found out his mother had turned around, he cursed Mr. Putin and wept for hours\nuntil he fell asleep. "Your mother can't just fly over like a bird," his grandmother told him, in an\neffort to calm him down.\n\nMs. Sirotiuk arrived back in Lviv early the following morning and stayed in the city for 24 hours,\nsleeping at a friend's house. The following day, as she was en route to the train station, she met\n\na Polish man who had been traveling between Poland and Lviv, bringing humanitarian aid. He\noffered her and a Ukrainian mother with two children a ride to the border, where she crossed on\nfoot into Poland.\n\nOn March 3, at the Medyka border crossing in southeastern Poland, five days after the start of\nher trek, an exhausted Ms. Sirotiuk sat on a plastic chair in a concrete parking lot filled with\nUkrainian women and children who were rifling through cardboard boxes containing food and\nclothing brought by Polish volunteers.\n\nShe was paralyzed with grief. "I had no other choice," she said at the time.\n\nHer regret was compounded by happy news from another Ukrainian mother who had\nsucceeded. Olena Opilat, who had befriended Ms. Sirotiuk on the train going to Zaporizhzhia\nover a 3 a.m. cigarette break, was able to retrieve her children, who lived in the city.\n\nBack in Ustronie Morskie, Ms. Sirotiuk is struggling to cope with her son's absence. She has\ntaken leave from work, is taking anti-anxiety medication and has deep feelings of guilt. Without\nNazariy, she said, "there's just emptiness."\n\nNazariy, under Russian occupation, spends his days playing computer games and helping his\ngrandparents plant onions and other vegetables in their sprawling garden. He visits his uncle\nand his 19-year-old cousin, who live nearby. In the evenings, he watches the Ukrainian TV\nnews with his grandmother. School has been suspended indefinitely.\n\nHe sometimes sees Russian military trucks emblazoned with a white Z, which has become a\npro-war symbol in Russia. He echoes his mother's advice about the soldiers. "If we don't touch\nthem, they won't touch us."\n\nA brief cease-fire and humanitarian corridor were announced on social media on March 9 for\npeople to leave the area that day for Zaporizhzhia, but with their internet connection down, Ms.\nSirotiuk's family never knew about it.\n\nNazariy has taken to telling his mother about ingenious escape plans. Maybe he can hide inside\na box and strap wheels to it? Or hitch a ride? Recently, he asked: "Could you send me over as\na parcel?"\n\nHe told his mother he plans to attempt the journey out of Ukraine on his own.\n\n"I'm terrified that he may do this," Ms. Sirotiuk said. She has been pressing her mother to keep\nbetter watch over him.\n\nThe area around her parents' village is calmer, with Russian forces in control. But Zaporizhzhia\nhas become more treacherous. It is a major destination for thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the\nbombardment of Mariupol, a port city to the southeast. On March 16, officials in Zaporizhzhia\nsaid it had been struck by Russian shelling for the first time, with the railway station and the\narea around the botanical garden hit.\n\nMs. Sirotiuk said she has exhausted her contacts in Ukraine in a futile effort to arrange safe\npassage for her son. She is considering another trip to try to retrieve him as early as this week.\nShe's been told prices to go into the hot zone start at $1,000.\n\n"How can you go on? What for?" she said. "I just don't know where I can find joy when I am\nwithout my child."\n\n\n\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n\n</td>

      <td>\n[Financial Analysis and Commentary]\n\nIf you thought Silicon Valley had a problem with politics, look at Russia's top internet company.\n</td>
      <td>\nNasdaq-listed Yandex, which runs the largest Russian search engine and ride-hailing service, is\ncaught between its local customers and regulators on the one hand, and U.S. technology and finance\non the other. The latest flashpoint is the potential sale of its media interests, which consist of a\nnews-aggregation service and a social platform called Zen.\n\nSince Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin cracked down on dissident voices. Yandex's\naggregator, which under local regulations is only allowed to show licensed content, displays news that\nhews ever more closely to the official line.\n\nOne casualty is Yandex's former executive director and deputy chief executive, Tigran Khudaverdyan,\nwho recently was sanctioned by the European Union. The EU cited the news service, as well as Mr.\nKhudaverdyan's attendance of a Kremlin meeting on the day of the invasion, as reasons for putting\nhim on the sanctions list. He resigned from his Yandex roles.\n\nBefore his sanctioning, Mr. Khudaverdyan wrote a Facebook post arguing that, although "war is a\nmonstrous thing," Yandex needed to keep its head below the parapet and carry on offering tech\nsolutions to the Russian people. The company now seems to be taking a similar view by "exploring\nstrategic options" for its news aggregator and Zen. It is trying to position itself as an apolitical\ntechnology provider.\n\nFast-growing Zen is much more valuable than the aggregator and hasn't yet come in for criticism. As\npressure increases on the likes of Facebook to take more responsibility for the content on their\nplatforms, Yandex appears to see a risk that its social-media channel could also become a problem.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges the company faces is a brain drain if its well-educated staff see its\napolitical stance as little better than complicity in President Vladimir Putin's repressive rule. Until now,\nthe company kept at the cutting edge of consumer technology by retaining bright Russian computer\nscientists who could easily get jobs in the U.S. Some will leave; the only question is how many.\n\nThis is by no means the company's only problem. Imports of vital technology hardware are on pause\nas vendors wait to see how sanctions play out. Trading in its stock is suspended, which triggered an\nobligation it can't readily meet to redeem a $1.25 billion convertible bond. Russia's economy is under\nintense pressure, which will hit the company's growth.\n\nYandex's search business is highly profitable, which should provide some financial security while it is\ncut off from Western capital. That stands in contrast to the situation at Ozon, a cash-burning\ne-commerce company pitched as Russia's Amazon.com in a Nasdaq initial public offering less than 18\nmonths ago. Still, Yandex will need to tighten its belt: Its strategy of plowing search profits into\nless-developed markets such as food delivery is no longer viable.\n\n\n\nIn November, the company hit a peak market value of about $31 billion. Its shares are now literally\nuninvestable with an aggregate value below $7 billion. Such dramatic falls from grace usually follow\ncorporate scandals, not geopolitical ones companies can do little to resolve. Yandex's refuge in a\nstudied neutrality just shows how few good options it has.\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian forces are seeking to roll back Russian gains as Moscow shifts its focus to\ncontrolling a swath of the country's south and east.\n\nUkrainian forces said on Sunday they drove Russian troops out of Trostyanets, in the northeast near\nthe Russian border, potentially opening a road to the provincial capital of Sumy, which is encircled by\nthe Russians.\n</td>
      <td>\nWestern officials saw signs that Russia is consolidating its position to regain the offensive, and\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine urged the West to provide his army with the heavier\nweapons it needs to fight the better-armed Russian military.\n\nThe retaking of Trostyanets comes after Moscow, having faced stiff resistance from the Ukrainians in\nits initial, multifront offensive, said on Friday that it would refocus its campaign on the eastern Donbas\nregion, where Russian forces hold a position of strength.\n\nRussian forces have dug into defensive positions in the north and around the capital, Kyiv, which it\nhas failed to seize.\n\nRussia's firepower is currently concentrated on Mariupol, a strategically important city linking\nRussian-controlled parts of the Donbas with territory Moscow has captured in the south.\n\nRetaking Trostyanets "demonstrates that the Ukrainians are able to counterattack, which means\nRussia can't assume that once they hold ground they have secured it," said Jack Watling, an expert\non land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank. "That limits the amount of\nresource they can apply to the place they are trying to take at any one time."\n\nHowever, Western officials believe Russia is now reinforcing in the Donbas region with fresh troops\nfrom the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary organization, with the goal of encircling Ukrainian\nforces.\n\nIt isn't clear how well-trained these new Russian troops will be and whether they will have access to\nenough high-grade weaponry to make quick gains against battle-hardened Ukrainian troops there.\n\nThe new battalion tactical groups come from Russia's eastern military district, which experts said is\nthe least battle-trained and well-equipped.\n\nHowever, refocusing the attack on a narrower front could solve some of the logistics problems that\nhave dogged Russian forces and allow their dominant air power to assert itself.\n\nWestern officials estimated that as much as a fifth of the Russian force is no longer combat-effective\nand that morale is low.\n\nBut they warn that the war is far from won for Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n"What we are not seeing is turning the tide, what we are seeing is some individual success," one\nofficial said. The creation of new Russian battalion tactical groups indicates that President Vladimir\nPutin of Russia is still going "all in," the official said.\n\nKyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's head of military intelligence, said on Sunday that Russia sought to partition\nthe country by merging territories in the east and south under its control into a single statelet.\n\n"This is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine," Mr. Budanov said.\n\nIn territories under its control, Russia is seeking to establish parallel authorities and forcing people to\nreject the Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia, Mr. Budanov said.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian negotiators will hold their next face-to-face meeting in Istanbul this week,\nTurkey said on Sunday. The office of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Tukrey said he urged Mr.\nPutin in a phone call on Sunday to accept a cease-fire with Ukraine.\n\nWestern officials said they saw little sign that Russia is willing to see a peaceful resolution to the\nconflict.\n\n"No one thinks there is the chance of a diplomatic solution in the next few days or even few weeks," a\nsenior European Union official said. Mr. Putin is "going to keep on pushing and trying to overhaul" the\nUkrainian government.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last week that even if a cease-fire is agreed to, the West must\nfurther arm Ukraine to strengthen "the quills of the Ukrainian porcupine as to make it in future\nindigestible to the Russian invaders."\n\n"This is just the beginning," he said. "We must support a free and democratic Ukraine in the long\nterm."\n\nDuring a visit to Warsaw on Saturday, President Biden said Mr. Putin's invasion of Ukraine had ignited\na "new battle for freedom" between democracies and autocracies.\n\nMr. Biden also called Mr. Putin "a butcher" and appeared to call for his ouster. A White House official\nlater walked back Mr. Biden's remark, which was dismissed by the Kremlin.\n\nMr. Biden's remark drew criticism, with some saying it undermined diplomatic efforts. Ukrainian\nofficials, though, praised Mr. Biden.\n\nAsked about Mr. Biden's remark on CNN, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said,\n"It is clear to us that Russia is a terrorist state, led by a war criminal."\n\nWhile Mr. Biden was in Warsaw, Russian missiles struck a site about 210 miles away, near the\nwestern Ukrainian city of Lviv, which has become a hub both for people displaced by the fighting and\nfor arms and other materiel the West is sending to support Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe Russian strikes on Lviv damaged a plant used to repair and modernize Tor missile systems, radar\nsystems and other equipment for the Ukrainian army, according to a Sunday briefing by Defense\nMinistry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov of Russia.\n\nThe mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, said the strikes had hit a fuel-storage facility and other\ninfrastructure, and that military infrastructure had been removed from the city around the time the war\nbegan.\n\nIn a speech late Saturday, a visibly irritated Mr. Zelensky renewed his plea for tanks, planes and\nmissile-defense systems. "This is what our partners have. This is what is covered with dust at their\nstorage facilities," he said.\n\n"It cannot be acceptable for everyone on the Continent if the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia and the\nwhole of Eastern Europe are at risk of a clash with the Russian invaders," he said. "At risk only\nbecause they left only one percent of all NATO aircraft and one percent of all NATO tanks somewhere\nin their hangars. One percent. We did not ask for more. And we do not ask for more. And we have\nalready been waiting for 31 days."\n\nNATO members have sent Kyiv large quantities of military, nonlethal and humanitarian assistance, but\nit still falls short of what Mr. Zelensky has publicly requested.\n\nThe U.S. and NATO allies have sent portable antitank and antiaircraft weapons, as well as lethal\ndrones.\n\nMr. Zelensky has requested fighter planes, tanks and antiaircraft systems capable of hitting Russian\nwarplanes at high altitude, but said Ukraine hasn't received what it needs.\n\nA NATO spokeswoman cited on Sunday comments by alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg\non the same issue following a summit on Thursday.\n\n"We all listened very carefully to President Zelensky," Mr. Stoltenberg said, declining to give details of\nsystems being supplied. "But what I can say is that allies do what they can to support Ukraine with\nweapons so Ukraine can defend" itself.\n\nMeanwhile, in a video, Taras Savchenko, the deputy head of the Sumy regional administration,\nshowed the destroyed Russian tanks left behind in Trostyanets.\n\nOn Sunday, the brigade involved in retaking the town said Russian forces had left behind weapons,\nequipment and ammunition that they would use to recapture other Ukrainian cities under Russian\ncontrol.\n\nMany facilities in the town, including a hospital, remain studded with mines, said Dmytro Zhyvytskyi,\nhead of the Sumy regional administration. Deliveries of medical supplies, food and other aid are being\narranged, he said.\n\n---\n\nDaniel Michaels, Warren P.

      <td>\nKYIV, Ukraine -- The thud of a Russian missile shook the glass of the hospital windows shortly after\ndawn last week. An hour later, the ragged clump of elderly civilians with bloody faces tottered into an\nemergency entrance, looking top-heavy with piles of bandages on their heads.\n\nWhen nurses helped them shed their padded jackets, shards of glass from the folds of their clothing\nsprinkled to the floor like confetti. Nurses wheeled them to operating rooms on steel gurneys, where\ndoctors spent more than an hour using tweezers to pull more shards out of their faces, hands and the\nbuttocks of one man who lay on his stomach clenching his fists.\n</td>
      <td>\nThen doctors stitched their wounds shut.\n\nKyiv's Clinical Hospital #8 was a center of excellence for scheduled surgeries on problems like\nhernias and heart valves. Then Russia's invasion swept up to the edge of Kyiv, turning it into a\nfront-line medical facility.\n\nDermatologists and cardiologists now help triage patients. Staff no longer duck for cover when there\nare air raid warnings. "Of course we are not what we used to be, but neither is the rest of the\ncountry," said Igor Khomenko, director of the hospital.\n\nAlong with millions of Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 who are mobilized for service, Dr. Khomenko has\nabridged his hopes for normalcy. For 30 years, he worked as a military surgeon, and earlier this year\nquit the military to try civilian life as head of Hospital #8.\n\nLike many Ukrainians, Dr. Khomenko was aware of threats from Russia but didn't expect a full-scale\nwar.\n\nTwo weeks after he quit the military, the invasion began. Since then he has been sleeping on a couch\nin his office, while his wife has taken refuge far in western Ukraine. As patients arrive, he paces the\nhallways of the emergency wing of the hospital, barking orders to move patients along.\n\n"I tried civilian life and it didn't last long," he said.\n\nHe canceled scheduled surgeries and dismissed half of the staff, so that now only 200 of the\nhospital's beds are ready for occupancy. Whole floors of the hospital stand empty and dark,\nconforming to a citywide blackout at night to make Kyiv a harder target for Russian bombing.\n\nThe types of wounds that the hospital encounters have evolved, Dr. Khomenko said. In the first week,\nthe hospital received a tide of gunshot wounds. Soon more patients arrived with shrapnel wounds\nand concussions.\n\nThe hospital's easy proximity to the fighting saved some lives, Dr. Khomenko said. Normally,\nbattlefield wounded are treated on the field and then at mobile field hospitals before they are moved\nto larger facilities. But Hospital #8 is so close to the fighting that some wounded move directly from\nbattle to the operating room.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Khomenko operated on one man early in the invasion who was shot through the heart. The\nhospital was able to save him because staff had time to crack open his chest and sew the hole shut\nbefore he bled to death.\n\nLike front-line hospitals in any war, controlling bleeding is the most important function of its\nemergency room, and massive blood transfusions are common, surgeons at the hospital said. Dr.\nKhomenko said that has made the hospital's leading vascular surgeon, Makhmud Akmad, a leader in\ntrauma treatment.\n\nBorn in Gaza, Dr. Akmad came to Ukraine to study medicine and decided to stay after meeting a\nfellow student who became his wife. Until last month he mostly performed scheduled heart surgeries.\nAfter Russia's invasion, he and his wife moved into one of the hospital's rooms with their daughter\nand son, who is studying to be a vascular surgeon like him.\n\nTogether, he and his son are on 24-hour call, running to the emergency room whenever several\nwounded patients appear there.\n\nWhile Kyiv has suffered few civilian casualties compared with other Ukrainian cities, the human\ncarnage is becoming more common.\n\nThe missile strike that sent patients to the hospital last week with glass cuts landed near an\napartment block in the early morning. Anatoly Grytsan, 64, was watching a newscast in his living\nroom while his mother, 92, sat next to the television.\n\nMr. Grytsan said he doesn't remember hearing an explosion -- only a flash outside and the windows\nto the apartment blew inside. One shard of glass ripped his hand and another across his forehead.\nThe blood coming down his face made it impossible to see what happened next. "We didn't know\nwhat to think," he said.\n\nHe said he fumbled across the room to his mother, who wasn't cut by flying glass because she was\nshielded by the television. He guided her to their front door, but it wouldn't budge because the blast\nhad bent the door frame. Some rescue workers arrived and broke down the door.\n\nHe spoke to his mother by phone and learned she wasn't seriously hurt. Doctors cleaned and stitched\nhis own wounds and wound a bandage around his head and gave him a set of secondhand clothes.\n\nSitting in his hospital room, he said he doesn't know yet where he and his mother will live after\ndoctors release them. "But maybe I will be here for a while," he said.\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nFinance chiefs at Western companies that continue to operate and sell products in Russia have to\ndecide what to do with the profits generated from those businesses.\n\nA month into the war, several companies have said they will donate profits derived from Russia to aid\nhumanitarian-relief efforts in Ukraine, while others continue to book those profits as part of their\nglobal earnings.\n</td>
      <td>\nSuch considerations are likely to become pressing questions ahead of the quarterly close at the end\nof this month as these measures could face scrutiny from shareholders. The war also has exposed\nhow many global companies -- both large and small -- have business ties to Russia.\n\n"This is something that each company needs to decide," said Amit Khandelwal, a professor for global\nbusiness at Columbia Business School, referring to the question around Russian profits. "A company\nhas obligations to its employees -- both Russian and non-Russian -- shareholders and customers,"\nhe said.\n\nA roster of international companies, including Bayer AG, Nestle SA, Danone SA, Kimberly-Clark\nCorp., Unilever PLC and PepsiCo Inc. say they keep selling in Russia to provide essential supplies,\nincluding cancer drugs, baby food and diapers. Among those products are potato chips, laundry\ndetergent and air fresheners.\n\nNestle said it is limiting products sold in Russia to baby food, specialist veterinary meals and other\nnutrition products, adding it would donate any profit to humanitarian organizations. The company said\nit doesn't know how it will report the donations to investors.\n\nConsumer-goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which continues to sell products in Russia, said it is\ndonating money and products to aid Ukrainians.\n\nPharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. will continue to supply medication to Russia but will donate all profit\nto support Ukraine's relief efforts, Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said. "Maintaining the\nsupply of medicines to Russia does not mean we will continue doing business as usual in Russia,"\nthe company said.\n\nUnilever, PepsiCo and Kimberly-Clark didn't respond to requests for comment, while Danone and\nBayer pointed to existing statements that don't mention their profits from Russia. AstraZeneca PLC\ndeclined to comment on what it plans to do with profits from its medication sales in Russia.\n\nOther companies may find it harder to give up revenue and profits generated in Russia, especially if\nthey have large business interests in the country.\n\nMetro AG, a German wholesaler that generated about 2.4 billion euros in sales -- equivalent to $2.64\nbillion -- or 10% of its total revenue from its Russian business during the latest fiscal year, said it will\ncontinue its operations there. The company declined to comment on whether it would consider\ndonating the profits generated in Russia.\n\n\n\nThe depreciation of the ruble -- which has declined more than 20% against the dollar since Feb. 24 --\nand other currencies has made the decision easier for some companies that say it isn't worth the\neffort or the reputational risk to keep booking profits from Russia.\n\n---\n\nSaabira Chaudhury and Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has delayed or derailed international collaborations studying climate\nchange in the Arctic, with many Western scientists and scientific organizations cutting ties with\nRussian research institutions and canceling planned meetings or expeditions in Russia or Russian\nwaters.\n\nInternational tensions over the conflict could cripple research focused on a region that -- along with the\nAntarctic -- helps regulate climate across the globe, scientists say. Russia is one of eight countries that\ncontrol land and ocean territories in the region north of the Arctic Circle.\n</td>
      <td>\n"The Russian territorial waters and Russian coastline comprise a huge part of the region. We really\nneed to know the full Arctic," said Matthew Shupe, a University of Colorado Boulder atmospheric\nscientist. "If we're limiting access to those regions, we're going to miss out on some key knowledge to\nbetter understand how and why the Arctic system is changing."\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which conducts ecological and weather\nmonitoring in the Arctic, says war-related tensions haven't affected its activities there. "All NOAA\nprojects and observations are proceeding in the Arctic," an agency spokesperson said.\n\nThat isn't the case with other key players in Arctic research.\n\nDr. Shupe is a co-leader of an international Arctic research initiative to study climate change known as\nMOSAiC, for the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate. As part of the\nproject, scientists aboard the German research ship Polarstern recently spent a year collecting data in\nthe region. Fieldwork for the expedition, which ended in October 2020, involved hundreds of crew,\nsupport staff and scientists, including up to 10 researchers from Russia, Dr. Shupe said.\n\nBut now Russian scientists aren't expected at an April meeting when MOSAiC researchers will discuss\nthe expedition's data, said Markus Rex, MOSAiC expedition leader and head of atmospheric physics at\nthe Alfred Wegener Institute, the German organization that led the project.\n\n"We're looking at this big pile of data, and they bring a lot of expertise to the table," Dr. Shupe said of\nhis Russian collaborators.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington didn't respond to requests for comment about the exclusion of\nRussian scientists and interruptions to other scientific collaborations.\n\nLocal organizers barred Russian scientists this month from the Arctic Science Summit Week, an\nArctic-research meeting taking place in Tromso, Norway, hosted by the International Arctic Science\nCommittee, or IASC. The group is a coordinator of international research in the Arctic and includes\nscientists from 23 countries.\n\n"In Arctic research, our ability to understand these rapid changes that are unfolding is like putting parts\nof the puzzle together -- and without Russia you're missing a big part of that picture," said Matthew\nDruckenmiller, the U.S. delegate to the IASC council and a geophysicist at the National Snow and Ice\nData Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\n\nThe organizers acknowledged that barring researchers from Russian institutions and organizations\nwould complicate research efforts. Monitoring in Russian territories and working with Russian experts\nare essential to fully understanding Arctic climate and the global consequences of changes in the\nregion, Jorgen Berge and Geir Gotaas, chair and vice-chair, respectively, of the local organizing\ncommittee for the conference, said in an email. But the conflict required them to take action, they said.\n\n"We are -- as ever -- strong supporters of scientific collaboration, but in the current situation the\nscientific benefits of maintaining official links with Russian institutions are outweighed by the need to\ntake a clear stand against the actions of the Russian government," Drs. Berge and Gotaas said.\nRussian scientists from non-Russian organizations could still attend, they said.\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nPresident Biden's pledge to boost U.S. liquefied natural-gas exports to Europe marks a further retreat\nfrom his hard-line stance against fossil fuels, sending share prices surging for natural-gas companies.\n\nThe president, who campaigned on a platform to transition the U.S. to cleaner energy, on Friday said\nthe U.S. is working to ship 50 billion cubic meters of LNG to Europe annually through at least 2030 to\nhelp the continent wean itself from dependence on Russian supplies.\n</td>
      <td>\nThe announcement came a day after Democrats on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\nbacktracked on new environmental policies, suspending implementation of heightened requirements\non reviews that industry officials and Republicans said would impede gas-pipeline development.\n\nShares of large U.S. natural-gas companies rose 9% on average Friday as major stock indexes were\nmixed. Shares of EQT Corp. and Southwestern Energy Co., two large producers, shot up to close\nabout 12% and 16% higher.\n\nCheniere Energy Inc., the top U.S. exporter, was up about 5.5%. Tellurian Inc., which is seeking\nfinancing for an LNG project, soared 21%.\n\nThe gas industry's prospects have been a concern among the sector's executives because of Mr.\nBiden's stance against fossil fuels. But the president has softened some of his positions in the wake of\nrising energy costs, which have been driven in part by the economic rebound from Covid-19, and more\nrecently by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe White House pivot has also put the U.S. and its vast oil and gas reserves in shale rock back at the\ncenter of a global scramble for energy resources as a bulwark against petrostates and authoritarian\nregimes. The U.S. is the world's largest oil and gas producer.\n\nDaniel Yergin, the vice chairman of S&amp;P Global and a noted oil-industry historian, called recent\ndevelopments "a huge turn."\n\n"There's a recognition now that shale -- and particularly LNG -- is a real geopolitical asset," he said.\n\nMr. Biden and his advisers have said they are still committed to ending the world's reliance on fossil\nfuels, including gas, and will continue to fund renewable energy as part of their work with European\nallies. But they also acknowledged the need to deal with the reliance that exists today.\n\n"While gas is still a substantial part of the energy mix, we want to make sure that the Europeans do not\nhave to source that gas from Russia," national-security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Friday.\n\nToby Rice, chief executive of top U.S. natural-gas producer EQT, said the Biden administration's shift\nis an extremely encouraging political signal that natural gas will play a key role in the world's future\nenergy mix.\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nSerhiy Prytula recently posted a video requesting help for Ukraine's military. Beside him was a man in\na balaclava and another holding a piece of shrapnel.\n\nThe shrapnel, he said, came from a Russian warplane shot down by a Ukrainian fighter who is part of\na unit hunting enemy vehicles and aircraft in pickup trucks.\n</td>
      <td>\n"Our guys are working, burning enemy vehicles," said Mr. Prytula in the March 8 Facebook post. "If\nyou have an off-road pickup truck, please give it to us or let us buy it off you."\n\nMr. Prytula said his initiative, dubbed "Hell Rides," has since provided more than 50 vehicles to\nUkraine's military.\n\nThe 40-year-old comedian and TV host is a leading figure in the grass-roots effort to equip Ukraine's\narmed forces to fight Russia.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies are providing Ukraine with weapons such as missiles to target tanks and\naircraft. The likes of Mr. Prytula, who said his organization has raised the equivalent of around $8.5\nmillion in the month since the conflict started, are trying to quickly fill gaps in nonlethal equipment,\nfrom body armor to drones with thermal imaging.\n\nThe effort has helped Ukraine halt the advance of Russia's better-equipped invading force in many\nparts of the country. In Ukraine's war of skirmishes and ambushes, where small, nimble teams are\ninflicting costly damage on Russian troops, basic gear can make a big difference.\n\nThe Ukrainian resistance, ranging from the thousands of volunteers who joined the military to those\nstaffing the ad hoc supply network, suggests the defensive effort is durable.\n\nMr. Prytula started his fund in 2014, when Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula and invaded eastern\nUkraine. He trucked body armor, drones and other equipment to the front lines, posting videos on\nsocial media and winning the trust of soldiers and donors.\n\nWith an online following of more than one million, donations poured in when the war started in\nFebruary. On the second day of the war, Mr. Prytula posted a photo of 100 drones bought for the\nequivalent of $250,000.\n\nFrom a new headquarters in central Kyiv, Mr. Prytula has put out a call for supplies from medications\nto tourniquets and winter boots.\n\nAt first, they were buying whatever they could as fast as possible. "We need radios," he posted on\nFeb. 27. "At any price!"\n\nMr. Prytula's connections with the military soon helped him focus his efforts. Artillery units need\ndrones with thermal imaging so they can target enemy supply trucks at night. He has sent dozens of\npickup trucks to mobile groups that ambush enemy vehicles. Special-forces snipers have received\nthermal-imaging scopes.\n\n\n\nMr. Prytula has received funds from more than 30 foreign countries, including the U.S. and Europe,\nbut also China and Africa. He recently added a PayPal account. Orders are often delivered to towns\nin Poland on the border with Ukraine, where they are trucked to a logistics center in the western\nUkrainian city of Lviv. On Saturday, Russian strikes targeted the city.\n\nLida Koval, a Ukrainian Railways staff member, has become a vital cog in the informal system\nmoving supplies into Ukraine.\n\nMs. Koval, 36, has spent all but four days of the war aboard a passenger train packed with materiel\nfor the war effort -- some boxes destined for Kyiv, others for Lviv -- that has shuttled constantly\nbetween Ukraine and Poland.\n\nThe trip takes a full day in each direction. On the way out of Ukraine, the train is filled to double its\ncapacity, packed with women and children, Ms. Koval said. She keeps snacks for the children, who\nsometimes ask her for food. Once, she slept in the outdoor smoking area between train cars, so that\nsix children could stay in the cabin that is usually hers.\n\nAt the end of the line, she has an hour to rest. She showers using a bucket in the bathroom at the\nend of the train car. Then she heads back to Ukraine, her carriage full of medical and military\nsupplies. "The only difference is we're going with people one way and we're going with the help the\nother way," she said. "We're helping people in both directions."\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nWhen Russia unveiled previously secret details of its nuclear-weapons doctrine for the first time in\n2020, it confirmed something U.S. war planners had long suspected: Moscow would be willing to use\natomic arms to keep from losing a conventional war.\n\nSince Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February, he has repeatedly raised the\nspecter of nuclear war, invoking his country's atomic arsenal in an effort to deter the U.S. and the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization from getting involved in the conflict.\n</td>
      <td>\nBut as Mr. Putin's army has faced fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces strengthened by large\ninfusions of Western weaponry, concerns have grown in Washington and allied capitals that Russia\ncould consider using a so-called tactical nuclear weapon to gain the upper hand on the battlefield.\n\nSuch weapons, which generally have a less-powerful warhead than a strategic nuclear weapon carried\non an intercontinental ballistic missile, were part of Cold War military thinking, though they never\nfigured into arms-control agreements between the U.S. and Russia or the Soviet Union.\n\nThe move would be aimed at crushing Ukraine's will to fight, turning the tide of the war or signaling that\ncurrent levels of Western support -- including transfers of antitank and air-defense systems -- are\nintolerable, Russian and Western analysts say.\n\nThe first use of an atomic weapon since the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would likely\ncause major damage and radioactive contamination to any Ukrainian city hit -- and perhaps beyond,\ndepending on wind and other factors. It would also confront Washington and Europe with a major\nsecurity test.\n\n"We don't know exactly where it is, the red line where the Russian leadership considers using tactical\nnuclear weapons," said Petr Topychkanov, a researcher at the Stockholm International Peace\nResearch Institute. "The Russian leadership knows the value of ambiguity."\n\nFurther complicating efforts to predict Mr. Putin's actions, Mr. Topychkanov said, is that it is difficult to\ngauge the nature of Kremlin decision-making. "The biggest question is how rational the Russian\nleadership is right now," he said. "I don't know what kind of information he is getting."\n\nIn the days before the invasion, Mr. Putin led an exercise of Russia's strategic forces, launching some\nof the country's most cutting-edge missiles, like the hypersonic Kinzhal. At the start of the invasion, he\nwarned of consequences "the likes of which you have never seen in history" if the West intervened.\n\nDays later, he stirred concern, ordering his military to ensure the "special combat readiness" of his\nnuclear forces.\n\nWhile those threats were an overt nod to nuclear warfare, they failed to define where exactly Russia's\nred lines are, observers of Russia's nuclear policy say, giving Mr. Putin more latitude to escalate\nthreats if he feels the need or even strike.\n\n\n\n\nThe point of a tactical nuclear strike to end a conventional conflict, based on doctrine known as\n"escalate to de-escalate," is to change the rules on the battlefield while shifting the burden of\nescalation onto your opponent, said Elbridge Colby, co-founder of The Marathon Initiative, a policy\ninitiative focused on great-power competition.\n\n"Putin could use a smaller warhead to protect what his conventional forces are doing," he said. "The\nUkrainians may be the target, but the real target politically would be the U.S. and the West."\n\nDespite active signaling, Russia has demurred at the idea of using nuclear weapons. Mr. Putin's\nspokesman said on CNN that Moscow would use them only under existential threat, and Russian\nDeputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on state television: "We have a very responsible\napproach to that issue. We never escalate anything."\n\nWhile the U.S. on one hand has made it clear it has no plans to cross any nuclear red lines in Ukraine,\nWashington has signaled the presence of its nuclear-capable forces in Europe this month. Weeks\nbefore the invasion, the U.S. sent B-52 strategic bombers to exercise with British and European air\nforces.\n\n"There's already some kind of signaling going on in Europe," said Hans Kristensen, director of the\nNuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned against letting the war in Ukraine slip into a nuclear\nconflict and told Russia to stop its nuclear rhetoric.\n\n"Russia must stop its nuclear saber-rattling," Mr. Stoltenberg said last week ahead of a summit of the\nWestern military alliance's leaders in Brussels. "Any use of nuclear weapons will fundamentally change\nthe nature of the conflict, and Russia must understand that a nuclear war should never be fought and\nthey can never win a nuclear war."\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nReports from Ukraine are filled with stories of Javelin antitank missiles and Turkish Bayraktar TB2\nunmanned aerial vehicles taking out Russian tanks and armored vehicles. The Biden administration has\nannounced $800 million in defensive weapons for Ukraine, including Javelins, Stinger antiaircraft\nweapons and Switchblade drones. More amazing is what Ukraine has also been doing on the cheap.\nAnd I don't mean Molotov cocktails.\n\nWars are increasingly asymmetric -- the lesser-armed side can put up a strong fight. The U.S. learned\nthis in Iraq with insurgent use of improvised explosive devices, basically roadside bombs triggered with\ncellphones. Similarly, Ukraine has been deploying inexpensive, almost homemade weapons and using\ntechnology to its advantage.\n</td>
      <td>\nThe Times of London reports that Ukraine is using $2,000 commercial octocopter drones, modified with\nthermal imagers and antitank grenades, to find and attack Russian tanks hiding between homes in\nvillages at night. Ukraine's Aerorozvidka, its aerial reconnaissance team, has 50 squads of drone pilots\nwho need solid internet connections to operate.\n\nWhen the internet was cut in Syria in 2013, enterprising techies set up point-to-point Wi-Fi connections\nto bring internet access from across the border in Turkey. You can do this with Pringles potato-chip\ncans and $50 off-the-shelf Wi-Fi routers. Ukraine may be spared this ad hoc setup as Elon Musk and\nhis firm Starlink have donated thousands of satellite internet-access terminals to Ukraine, including to\nthe Aerorozvidka squads, which come with warnings to camouflage the antennas. They typically cost\n$499 each and $99 a month for service.\n\nUkraine also effectively jammed Russia's long-in-the-tooth wireless military-communication technology,\nwhich apparently uses a single-frequency channel to operate. Former Central Intelligence Agency\nDirector David Petraeus told CNN that Russians were then forced to use cellphones to communicate\nuntil Ukraine blocked the +7 country code for Russia and eventually took down 3G services that Russia\nuses for secure connections. Russian soldiers were forced to steal Ukrainian cellphones to\ncommunicate with one another. That's no way to fight a war.\n\nUkraine also has taken advantage of crowdsourcing. The Journal told the story of Russian tanks that\nwould fire on the city of Voznesensk and then back up a few hundred yards to avoid return fire. Civilians\nand Territorial Defense volunteers would then message the tanks' new coordinates via the Viber\nsocial-messaging app.\n\nThe propaganda war is also being fought on the cheap, from President Volodymyr Zelensky's Zoom call\nwith the U.S. Congress to Ukraine's work spreading news inside Russia. The Russians have blocked\nFacebook and Twitter, independent media has been shut down, and on Russian television no one is\nallowed to say "invasion" or "war." But no country can completely filter and firewall real news. The\nTelegram and WhatsApp messaging apps encrypt their communications. Ukraine has begun using\nfacial recognition to identify killed and captured Russian soldiers, even contacting their families and\nposting their photos on Telegram channels. Twitter now is using a service to disguise its origin and\nrestore service to Russian users.\n\n\n\n\nMost surprisingly, after much hype and many warnings, Russian cyberwarfare has been deemed fairly\nineffective. Hours before the invasion, someone, presumably the Russians, launched a Trojan.Killdisk\nattack, disk-wiping malware that hit Ukrainian government and financial system computers and took\ndown Parliament's website. Cyberattack tracking firm Netscout called the attack "modest." A Ukrainian\nnewspaper then released a file with details on 120,000 Russian soldiers, including names, addresses,\nphone and passport numbers. Where the information came from is unknown.\n\nBut we have a hint. Ukraine is filled with smart coders, and the government set up an "IT Army of\nUkraine" Telegram channel to coordinate digital attacks on Russian military digital systems. As many as\n400,000 have volunteered so far. An officer of the Ukraine State Service of Special Communications\nsaid they were engaged in "cyber-resistance." This digital flash mob has taken down Russian websites,\nthough I doubt we will ever fully know the damage it may have inflicted. This is definitely a\nsocial-network-influenced conflict.\n\nIn the fog of war, stories and disinformation swirl. Most are impossible to verify. I've heard of foreign\nvolunteers swarming to Ukraine who then post photos on Instagram. Both Facebook and Instagram\nstrip GPS location coordinates from smartphone photos, but they allow these volunteers to tag nearby\nlocations, potentially giving away refugees' hiding places. These could be targeted by Russian missiles\nand may have been the reason the Mariupol theater was destroyed.\n\nNew technology for use in commerce often emerges after the smoke of battle clears. World War I\nproduced tanks, field radios and improved airplanes. World War II brought radar, penicillin, nuclear\npower, synthetic rubber, Jeeps and even duct tape. What we are seeing in Ukraine is the asymmetric\npower of pervasive inexpensive commercial technology, especially citizen-empowering social networks\nand crowdsourcing. So far these tools have been altering the war's outcome. Welcome to 21st-century\nwarfare.\n\n---\n\nWrite to kessler@wsj.com\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nConventional wisdom has it that Beijing miscalculated by supporting Vladimir Putin's Ukraine war. Xi\nJinping's partner faces both unexpectedly fierce resistance from the Ukrainian military and surprisingly\nstrong Western punishment. Some in Washington expect China to attempt to extricate itself by\nbrokering a peace deal. This is unlikely to happen. In many ways China has benefitted from the\nconflict, as Russia tests the international system with disappointing results for the West.\n\nTrue, Beijing is taken aback by Russian military failures. The war will surely lead Mr. Xi to question his\nmilitary's ability to attack Taiwan. Yet Mr. Xi has long heralded a new era in international relations that\noverturns the U.S.-made world order. Mr. Putin signed on to this agenda in the Chinese-Russian Joint\nStatement of Feb. 4. From Beijing's perspective, a new international politics is emerging.\n</td>
      <td>\nFar from backing away from an anti-Western position, top Chinese diplomats are pressing their case.\nForeign Minister Wang Yi and Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng have made statements since the\ninvasion blaming the U.S. for not considering Russia's security concerns and denouncing the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization's eastward expansion. In China's telling, the world should have sympathy\nfor Ukraine not because it was attacked by Russia, but because it is the victim of a reckless U.S. bid to\nmaintain geopolitical dominance.\n\nAccording to Beijing, the lesson for small countries is don't be used as a pawn. The U.S. will\nmanipulate them into fighting proxy wars against its adversaries.\n\nChina's main target is Asia. In its narrative, the region can avoid Europe's fate if it resists Washington's\nefforts to contain China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has taken aim at the recently released U.S.\nstrategy for the Indo-Pacific, which envisions a political and economic order free of Chinese coercion.\nMr. Le warned that this strategy will "provoke trouble, put together closed and exclusive small circles or\ngroups, and get the region off course toward fragmentation and bloc-based division."\n\nThe American strategy "is as dangerous as the NATO strategy of eastward expansion in Europe," he\nadded. "If allowed to go on unchecked, it would bring unimaginable consequences and ultimately push\nthe Asia-Pacific over the edge of an abyss." This is a clear warning that if Washington builds an\nalliance system in Asia akin to NATO, China reserves the option to resist forcefully. In this view,\nRussia's case for attacking Ukraine sets a useful precedent.\n\nYet the world's response to the Ukraine invasion should ease Beijing's worry about the formation of\nanti-China blocs. Outside the West, America's partners seem to prefer neutrality when confronted with\nauthoritarian aggression. India, a crucial pillar of Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy, hasn't condemned\nRussia. In Southeast Asia, a region the U.S. views as strategically critical, most have remained neutral.\nWhile these countries may feel differently if China starts a conflict, the U.S. cannot count on that.\n\nAmerica's partners in the Middle East, strategically important to the U.S. because of their energy\nresources, are staying neutral as well. The Syrian war and Iran's regional aggression have made these\ncountries more dependent on China and Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven more gratifying for Beijing is that Japan's support of Ukraine has caused heightened tensions\nwith Russia. Moscow has called off negotiations to resolve territorial disputes and likely promised\nBeijing that it would resume joint exercises in the waters around Japan.\n\nIt turns out that the Sino-Russian Joint Statement was less an aspiration than a description of the\ncurrent state of international relations. With so many countries staying on the sidelines in the wake of\nthe Ukraine invasion, China has an opportunity to build greater support for its anti-American vision.\nOver the past decade, Russia has done much of this work by providing arms and extending its\ninfluence. China will also exploit distaste for promiscuous use of U.S. sanctions and American\nhectoring on human rights.\n\nChina hasn't miscalculated. It was right about the geopolitical fundamentals. And since few countries\njoined the West in resisting Russian aggression against a sovereign nation, Beijing may conclude that\nfewer still would punish it for an attack on Taiwan, which most of the world doesn't recognize as a\ncountry. Washington must urgently make a sustained diplomatic case to its partners that such an\nattack would devastate international security and prosperity.\n\nChina doesn't need allies to support its aggressive plans. It merely needs nations to stay neutral, and\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has given China more confidence that most of the world will stay on the\nsidelines.\n\n---\n\nMr. Blumenthal is director of Asian studies at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "The\nChina Nightmare: The Grand Ambitions of a Decaying State."\n\nLicense this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service\n</td>

      <td>\nRussia's war against Ukraine is failing. But serious dangers remain. Among them are "peace" terms\nthat, like those Russia imposed on past victims of its aggression, would set up Ukraine -- and others --\nfor bloodshed in the years to come. Vladimir Putin, who didn't bargain on a tough fight, is likely to\npropose terms that look like concessions but are calculated to hobble Ukraine and threaten security far\nbeyond its borders. Ukrainians won't accept such an endgame, and other countries should not try to get\nthem to do so.\n</td>
      <td>\nRussia's recent wars illustrate what Mr. Putin likely has in mind for Ukraine. In Georgia, which he\ninvaded in 2008; in Moldova, where Russian troops never left; and in Azerbaijan, where Russia\nsupported Armenian separatists in the early 1990s, fighting subsided but ambiguity followed. Russia's\nproxies -- a mix of puppets and Kremlin thugs -- proceeded to dig in behind semiofficial armistice lines.\nWith Russia's support, fiefs under these proxies in some cases have lasted to the present day.\n\nContributing to their persistence are the cease-fire terms. Neither continuing war nor cementing peace,\nthe terms deliberately debilitated the countries Russia had attacked by entrenching its proxies on each\ncountry's territory and stipulating "peace processes" that Moscow used not to pursue peace, but to\nprevent the countries from stabilizing or escaping Russia's shadow.\n\nHints from the Kremlin suggest that this is how Mr. Putin hopes to gain lasting ground from his botched\ninvasion. Mr. Putin insists that Ukraine accept the permanent loss of the three pieces of the country that\nRussia already has taken -- the Crimean Peninsula and the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nThat might sound like a clean-cut outcome, but it wouldn't be. If Russia wins the terms it demands, then\nother parts of Ukraine will fall under the shadow of contrived secessions, sham independence\nmovements and whatever other forms of subversion Mr. Putin might improvise. Brutal client outposts,\nfake referendums and forced population exchanges likely won't be limited to two or three parts of\nUkraine. Even if Mr. Putin makes a show of restraint at first, he would have convenient launchpads from\nwhich to do more harm. Under the endgame he likely is pursuing, Ukraine can expect no better a fate\nthan Georgia, Moldova or Azerbaijan, which endured coercion by Russia for decades.\n\nThe West tolerated Russia's strategy of creating and sustaining "frozen conflicts" against its smaller\nneighbors. This signaled to Mr. Putin in 2014 that it was safe to seize Crimea and conjure the rebel\ngroups through which Russia has ruled Donetsk and Luhansk and menaced Ukraine. Tolerating such\nan outcome in Ukraine would be a mistake.\n\nThe risks for the security of Europe are clear. Ukraine is larger than earlier victims of Russia's\naggression and post-armistice intrigues. It borders four countries -- Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and\nRomania -- in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and sets an example for the three NATO countries\nthe U.S.S.R. once directly ruled -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Permanent ambiguity and\ndestabilization in Ukraine aren't acceptable.\n\nThe horrors that Russia is inflicting on civilians in Ukraine add urgency to the search for peace. Ukraine\nmight reasonably consider concessions on the timing or terms of joining NATO or the European Union.\nBut concessions that give Russia permanent leverage over Ukraine will supply no peace. They will only\nset the stage for future war, and on the terms Mr. Putin prefers.\n\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky, affirming that Ukraine won't accept ultimatums, sees the danger of\naccepting Mr. Putin's terms. If the world wants peace and a secure Europe, then it shouldn't impose a\nsettlement on Ukraine that ignores lessons from places where Russia got the endgames it demanded.\n\n---\n\nMr. Grant served as senior adviser for strategic planning in the State Department's Bureau of\nInternational Security and Nonproliferation, 2019-21.

Mr. Putin signed on to this agenda in the Chinese-Russian Joint\nStatement of Feb. 4. From Beijing's perspective, a new international politics is emerging.\n</td>

increased <mark>funding</mark> for law enforcement in a $5.8 trillion budget, playing down his proposals for
expanding social programs in favor of backing initiatives generally favored by centrist

from his hard-line stance against fossil fuels, sending share prices surging for natural-gas companies.

The president, who campaigned on a <mark>platform</mark> to transition the U.S. to cleaner energy, on Friday said
the U.S. is working to ship 50 billion cubic meters of LNG to Europe annually through at least 2030 to
