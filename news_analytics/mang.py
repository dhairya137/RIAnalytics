CLM      East is East----SE       Opinion----HD       Russia Can't Depend on India Either; New Delhi may be frustratingly tolerant of Putin, but it isn't----         likely to help him substantively.----BY       By Sadanand Dhume----WC       914 words----PD       29 April 2022----ET       03:56----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         India's neutrality in the growing confrontation between Russia and the West over Ukraine is causing----         heartburn in Western capitals. But while disappointment may be justified, undue focus on New Delhi's----         unwillingness to condemn Moscow or impose sanctions misses an important detail: India's apparent----         forbearance toward Russia is largely symbolic. As a practical matter, New Delhi is unlikely to help its----         "special and privileged strategic partner" stave off Western pressure.--------TD----         Take energy. Since the conflict in Ukraine began, India has placed orders for at least 40 million barrels----         of Russian oil on the cheap—more than twice as much as it purchased in all of 2021. This might seem----         to signal a willingness to give Moscow the cash it desperately needs by increasing energy imports. As----         the world's third-largest importer of oil, India could make a big difference for Vladimir Putin. And the low----         price could make a big difference for New Delhi. According to a 2019 Reserve Bank of Indiastudy, every----         extra dollar a barrel India pays for oil imports increases the country's budget deficit by $1.25 billion.--------         But dramatically expanding oil imports from Russia would pose several practical difficulties for India.----         Though Russian oil may not face official sanctions, it still carries reputational risks, at which private----         companies spanning insurance to logistics to payments may balk. "They've tried to mop up some----         discounted prices on relatively modest contracts," says Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment for----         International Peace in a phone interview. "Actually getting vendors to bring that energy to India is----         proving to be quite a challenge."--------         Russian oil makes up a small fraction of Indian oil imports—only around 2% in 2021. Despite its recent----         purchases, India isn't among the top 10 importers of Russian energy. As Foreign Minister----         Subrahmanyam Jaishankarpointed out last month, this is unlikely to change. Most of Indian energy----         comes from Gulf nations that are friendly to America. As of 2020, its top three oil suppliers were Iraq,----         Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, while its top gas suppliers were Qatar and the U.S. With----         access to reliable energy supplies from the Gulf, Indian refiners don't need to turn to faraway Russia.--------         Indian businesses are also far more deeply integrated with the West than with Russia. At roughly $150----         billion a year, U.S.-India trade alone is more than 12 times as large as Russia-India trade. Indian----         billionaires like Mukesh Ambani own vacation homes in London and educate their children in the Ivy----         League. For many of them, cheaper energy simply isn't worth the potential risk of being cut off from U.S.----         financing or consumers.--------        Some could argue that even if New Delhi doesn't have economic incentives to buy up Russian oil, it----        could still offer Moscow a lifeline as the largest customer for another key Russian export: weapons. A----        little over a quarter of Russia's arms exports from 2017 through 2021 went to India. (The second-place----        recipient of Russian arms, China, accounted for about a fifth.)--------        India has compelling reasons to buy Russian weapons, Mr. Tellis says. Russian equipment tends to be----        cheaper to acquire than its Western equivalent, though the long-term operating costs can be higher.----        Russia also offers India its most sophisticated weapons—such as the Sukhoi Su-30 fighter and the----        S-400 missile defense system—while the West often holds back its newest gear.--------        Mr. Tellis also notes that Russia has had more success than the U.S. at co-producing and----        co-developing weapons with India, including the mid-range cruise missile BrahMos, named for the----        Brahmaputra and Moskva rivers. Russia's arms manufacturers are tightly linked to the government.----        Unlike American firms, they don't need to worry about justifying co-development decisions on----        commercial terms.--------        Despite all this, India's reliance on Russian arms has been declining—down from 69% of Indian arms----        purchases in 2012-16 to 46% in 2017-21. Western sanctions on Russia could accelerate this decline by----        undermining Russia's ability to maintain a sophisticated defense-industrial base. Russia's battlefield----        losses may also force its arms producers to focus on replenishing its own stocks over expanding----        exports. And though Moscow has been a reliable strategic partner to New Delhi in the past, its growing----        closeness to Beijing makes it less dependable. Mr. Tellis predicts a continued "gentle decline" in Indian----        arms imports from Russia, at least compared with India's imports from other nations such as the U.S.,----        Israel and France.--------        Another area of Indian cooperation with Russia is its membership in non-Western groupings such as----        Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), RIC (Russia, India, China) and the Shanghai----        Cooperation Organization. But these are really only talk shops with little policy coherence or influence.----        Besides, India's involvement is in large part meant to ensure that Russia does not draw too close to----        China, which may be fruitless at this point. None of these groupings will materially influence the----        outcome of the war in Ukraine.--------        As the conflict grinds on, many in the West will continue to bemoan India's unreliability. They should feel----        encouraged that Moscow can't rely on New Delhi either.--------        Russia Can't Depend on India Either--------IN      idef : Defense Equipment/Products | iaer : Aerospace/Defense | iindstrls : Industrial Goods--------NS      c13 : Regulation/Government Policy | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | e51 : Trade/External Payments----        | ecat : Economic News | gesanc : International Sanctions | gpir : Politics/International Relations | gtrade----        : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | ncolu : Columns | nedc : Commentaries/Opinions | gcat : Political/General----        News | gdip : International Relations | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E----        Executive News Filter | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter----RE      india : India | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | ndelh : New Delhi | uk :----        United Kingdom | ukrn : Ukraine | ussrz : CIS Countries | delhi : Delhi | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric :----        BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----        Central/Eastern Europe | indsubz : Indian Subcontinent | sasiaz : Southern Asia | weurz : Western----        Europe----IPD     Opinion |--------IPC     I/ARO--------PUB     Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN      Document WSJO000020220428ei4s008kd------------------------CLM     Declarations----SE      Opinion----HD      Putin Really May Break the Nuclear Taboo in Ukraine; It seems unthinkable, but American----        leaders' failure to think about it heightens the risk it will happen.----BY      By Peggy Noonan----WC      1,309 words----PD      29 April 2022----ET      03:56----SN      The Wall Street Journal Online----SC      WSJO----LA      English----CY      Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----        Sometimes a thing keeps nagging around your brain and though you've said it before you have to say it----        again. We factor in but do not sufficiently appreciate the real possibility of nuclear-weapon use by----        Russia in Ukraine. This is the key and crucial historic possibility in the drama, and it really could come to----        pass.--------        And once it starts, it doesn't stop. Once the taboo that has held since 1945 is broken, it's broken. The----        door has been pushed open and we step through to the new age. We don't want to step into that age.--------TD----        The war is in its third month. Diplomatic solutions are less likely than ever; war crimes and atrocities----        have hardened the Ukrainians, and in any case they're winning and the world is on their side. British----        intelligence this week reported Russia has lost around 15,000 troops, 2,000 armored vehicles and 60----        aircraft. The ground invasion force has lost an estimated 25% of its combat strength. Russia is grinding----        through a disaster.--------        We aren't worried enough about Russian nuclear use in part because we imagine such a thing as huge----        missiles with huge warheads launched from another continent and speeding through space. We think:----        That won't happen! It has never happened! But the more likely use would be not of big strategic nuclear----        weapons but smaller tactical ones on the battlefield. Such weapons have a shorter range and carry----        lower-yield warheads. America and Russia have rough parity in the number of strategic nuclear----        weapons, but Russia has an estimated 10 times as many tactical nuclear weapons as the U.S. and----        delivery systems that range from artillery shells to aircraft.--------        Why would Vladimir Putin use tactical nuclear weapons? Why would he make such a madman move?--------        To change the story. To shock and destabilize his adversaries. To scare the people of North Atlantic----        Treaty Organization countries so they'll force their leaders to back away. To remind the world—and----        Russians—that he does have military power. To avoid a massive and public military defeat. To win.--------        Mr. Putin talks about nuclear weapons a lot. He did it again Wednesday: In a meeting with politicians in----        St. Petersburg, he said if anyone intervenes in Ukraine and "creates unacceptable threats for us that are----        strategic in nature," the Russian response will be "lightning fast." He said: "We have all the tools for this----        that no one else can boast of having. We won't boast about it, we'll use them, if needed."--------        He's talked like this since the invasion. It's a tactic: He's trying to scare everybody. That doesn't mean----        the threat is empty.--------        There are signs the Russians are deliberately creating a historical paper trail, as if to say they warned----        us. On Monday Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the risk of nuclear conflict is "serious" and "should----        not be underestimated." Earlier, Anatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to Washington, sent a formal----        diplomatic note to the U.S. saying it was inflaming the conflict. The Washington Post got a copy. It said----        shipments of the "most sensitive" weapons systems to Ukraine were "adding fuel" to the conflict and----        could bring "unpredictable consequences."--------        The U.S. at the same time has become rhetorically bolder. This month President Biden referred to Mr.----        Putin as a war criminal. In March Mr. Biden called for regime change; the White House walked it back.----        This week Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters the U.S. aim in Ukraine: "We want to see----        Russia weakened to the degree it can't do the kinds of things it's done in Ukraine." The original----        American aim was to protect Ukraine's sovereignty and independence. Has the U.S. strategy changed,----        or has its officials' talk simply become looser? What larger strategic vision is the administration acting----        on?--------        In my experience with American diplomats, they are aware of but don't always grasp the full implications----        of their opponents' histories. Mr. Putin was a KGB spy who in 1991 saw the Soviet system in which he'd----        risen crash all around him. He called the fall of the Soviet Union a catastrophe because it left his country----        weakened, humiliated and stripped of dominance and hegemony in Eastern Europe. He is a walking,----        talking cauldron of resentments, which he deploys for maximum manipulation. He isn't secretive about----        his grievances. In his 2007 speech to the Munich Security Conference he accused the U.S. of----        arrogance, hypocrisy and having created a "unipolar world" with "one center of authority, one center of----        force, one center of decision making," headed by "one master, one sovereign." As for NATO, "we have----        the right to ask: Against whom is this expansion intended?"--------        Antagonism to the West has been the central intellectual organizing principle of his life. America is an----        object of his life's obsession.--------        So let me make an argument for my anxieties: For this man, Russia can't lose to the West. Ukraine isn't----        the Mideast, a side show; it is the main event. I read him as someone who will do anything not to lose.--------        In October he will turn 70, and whatever his physical and mental health his life is in its fourth act. I am----        dubious that he will accept the idea that the signal fact of its end will be his defeat by the West. He can't,----        his psychology will not allow it.--------        It seems to me he has become more careless, operating with a different historical consciousness. He----        launched a world-historic military invasion that, whatever his geostrategic aims, was shambolic—fully----        aggressive and confident, yet not realistically thought through. His army wasn't up to the task. It seemed----        thrown together, almost haphazard, certainly not professional.--------        Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, often notes that Mr. Putin has killed all----        the institutions in his country, sucked the strength, independence and respectability from them, as----        dictators do. They take out power centers that might threaten them but might also warn them of----        weaknesses in their own governments. All dictatorships are ultimately self-weakening in that way. But----        this means Mr. Putin has no collective leadership in Russia. It's all him. And he's Vladimir Putin.--------        When I look at him I see a new nihilistic edge, not the calculating and somewhat reptilian person of the----        past.--------        People who have known Mr. Putin have told me I am wrong in my concern about his potential nuclear----        use in that he knows if he makes one move with such a weapon, Moscow will in turn be reduced to a----        smoking ruin. But I am reading Mr. Putin as someone who's grown bored of that threat, who believes he----        can more than match it, who maybe doesn't even believe it anymore. In any case the Americans would----        not respond disproportionately.--------        No one since 1945, in spite of all the wars, has used nuclear weapons. We are in the habit, no matter----        what we acknowledge as a hypothetical possibility, of thinking: It still won't happen, history will proceed----        as it has in the past.--------        But maybe not. History is full of swerves, of impossibilities that become inevitabilities.--------        For the administration's leaders this should be front of mind every day. They should return to the----        admirable terseness of the early days of the invasion. They should wake up every day thinking: What----        can we do to lower the odds?--------        Think more, talk less. And when you think, think dark.--------        Putin Really May Break the Nuclear Taboo in Ukraine--------NS      gnuclw : Nuclear Weapons Programs | gvexe : Executive Branch | gpir : Politics/International Relations |----        gwar : War Crimes | ncolu : Columns | nedc : Commentaries/Opinions | gcat : Political/General News |----        gcns : National/Public Security | gcrim : Crime/Legal Action | gdef : Armed Forces | gpol : Domestic----        Politics | grisk : Risk News | gvbod : Government Bodies | gvio : Military Action | gweap : Weapons----        Programs | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter----------------RE      russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | namz : North----        America | uk : United Kingdom | usa : United States | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric :----        BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----        Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD     COLUMN--------IPC     N/GEN--------PUB     Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN      Document WSJO000020220428ei4s008hl------------------------CLM       Review & Outlook (U.S.)----SE        Opinion----HD        Congress's Turn to Step Up on Ukraine; Biden's request to help Kyiv is an investment in U.S.----          security.----BY        By The Editorial Board----WC        502 words----PD        29 April 2022----ET        04:25----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          The Biden Administration on Thursday rolled out a $33 billion request for assistance for Ukraine, and----          let's hope Congress doesn't suddenly plead poverty. Vladimir Putin seems set on a long war, and the----          investment in defeating him will be cheap if it succeeds.--------          About $20 billion of the package is earmarked for military aid, with more for a mix of humanitarian and----          economic assistance, as well as sanctions enforcement. "The cost of this fight is not cheap. But caving----          to aggression is going to be more costly, if we allow it to happen," said President Biden.--------TD----          The request includes such crucial Ukrainian needs as "accelerated cyber capabilities and advanced air----          defense systems"; increased intelligence support; and more "artillery, armored vehicles, anti-armor----          and anti-air capabilities." Ditto for funding for a "stronger NATO security posture" to underwrite U.S.----          troop deployments to deter a Putin foray into Poland or the Baltic states.--------          Congress can scrutinize and shape the details to ensure the Ukrainians will end up with long-range----          artillery, as well as training on more complex Western systems such as air defenses and unmanned----          vehicles. The Ukrainians also need systems that can operate together and at scale, not merely a----          potpourri of whatever is available in Western stocks.--------          A promising development on that front was this week's meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany,----          where Western countries discussed how better to coordinate military aid for Ukraine. Germany----          committed heavy weaponry such as 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft tanks. A test will be whether these----          weapons move into Ukraine at what U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called "the speed of war."--------          Another urgent priority is replenishing U.S. weapons stocks. A panel of Pentagon purchasing experts----          told Congress this week that the U.S. has burned one-third of its Javelin antitank supply in two months----          in Ukraine. Stinger anti-aircraft missiles are also dwindling. Refills will take years, owing to brittle or----          closed production lines, and better to get started now.--------          The risk, as ever, is that Mr. Biden's Ukraine funding becomes a hostage in Congress. Mr. Biden's----          Thursday letter to Congress mentions his request for $22.5 billion for more Covid-19 aid, and----          Democrats want to hold up Ukraine's weapons over domestic spending. Immigration fights also----          threaten to derail the bill.--------          But voters understand these are separate matters, and lawmakers can sort out their differences----          accordingly. The stakes in Ukraine are enormous for U.S. security. The war is in a crucial phase, as----          Russia tries to expand its control in Ukraine's east and crush the Ukrainian army. Defeating Mr. Putin's----          war of conquest is still possible, and the West can make the world safer by showing that an alliance of----          democracies can defeat a marauding dictator.--------          Congress's Turn to Step Up on Ukraine--------CO        uscong : United States Congress------------NS        gweap : Weapons Programs | gcat : Political/General News | gvexe : Executive Branch | gvbod :----          Government Bodies | gpir : Politics/International Relations | gpol : Domestic Politics | gvcng :----          Legislative Branch | gvio : Military Action | ncolu : Columns | nedc : Commentaries/Opinions | gcns :----          National/Public Security | gdef : Armed Forces | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content Types | nfact :----          Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter----RE        ukrn : Ukraine | eurz : Europe | namz : North America | uk : United Kingdom | usa : United States |----          dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD       Opinion |--------IPC       G/CNG--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220428ei4s00911------------------------CLM      Politics and Policy----SE       Politics----HD       Biden Asks Congress for $33 Billion to Support Ukraine; Package includes $20 billion in military----         and security assistance to maintain flow of weapons and ammunition to Kyiv----BY       By Ken Thomas----WC       1,239 words----PD       29 April 2022----ET       03:21----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         WASHINGTON—Democratic and Republican lawmakers welcomed President Biden's request for $33----         billion to fund weapons and provide longer-term economic and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, as the----         country's conflict with Russia enters its third month.--------         The proposal, announced by Mr. Biden Thursday, is designed to back Ukraine's war effort through the----         end of September. Lawmakers must now work out how to approve the aid while also trying to advance----         a package funding Covid-19 vaccines and treatments and resolving a dispute over U.S.-Mexico border----         policy.--------TD----         "We either back the Ukrainian people as they defend their country or we stand by as the Russians----         continue their atrocities and aggression in Ukraine," Mr. Biden said at the White House, terming it a----         "fight for freedom."--------         SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS--------         Does the proposed aid package offer the right amount of support for Ukraine? Join the conversation----         below.--------         Congress provided Ukraine earlier this year with $13.6 billion in military, humanitarian and economic----         aid as part of a broader spending bill, covering the first two months of the war. In his remarks, Mr.----         Biden said that money was nearly exhausted, requiring Congress to provide more to sustain Ukraine's----         defenses.--------         White House officials said of the $3.5 billion in that initial package devoted to shipping weapons and----         ammunition to Ukraine's military, about $250 million remains, making it important for Congress to act----         quickly.--------         Mr. Biden, who prepared the proposal after consulting with military and national security advisers,----         made the request to Congress as the U.S. and European allies prepare for a conflict that could----         continue for months.--------         Lawmakers, who returned from recess this week, backed the new proposal and said they were----         prepared to quickly approve another package of Ukraine aid. The House is out of Washington next----         week, putting off immediate action.--------         House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said Congress would provide Ukraine "all they need,"----         saying the country "is fighting for freedom and democracy, not only in their own homeland but----         throughout the world."--------         The proposal, described by administration officials, includes, $20.4 billion in military and security aid,----         an additional $8.5 billion in economic assistance to help Ukraine respond to the crisis and provide----------------          basic services for its people and another $3 billion in humanitarian aid, including efforts to support the----          nation's wheat crop and food supply.--------          Administration officials said it would also include "targeted funding" of an additional $500 million to----          address economic disruptions at home and abroad, particularly to help increase the production of crops----          such as wheat and soybeans.--------          Mr. Biden said the military aid "would provide even more artillery, armored vehicles, anti-armored----          systems, anti-air capabilities that have been used so effectively in the battlefield by Ukrainian warriors."--------          The House on Thursday voted 417-10 to approve legislation to create a lend-lease agreement----          designed to speed up the transfer of military equipment to Ukraine, similar to what the U.S. did with----          Britain in World War II. The Senate passed the bill earlier this month.--------          Inside the Russian Siege of Mariupol--------          Recent photos reveal the suffering of residents in the once-thriving Ukrainian city--------          Already, the U.S. has sent nearly $4 billion worth of military equipment to Ukraine this year. The gear----          has ranged from small drones to helicopters to Javelin anti-armor and Stinger antiaircraft systems, and----          more recently, heavy artillery, including Howitzers.--------          The first batch of training on those Howitzers, which occurred outside Ukraine, is complete, a senior----          defense official said Thursday. Additional training, on a radar system the U.S. has provided and on----          armored personnel carriers, is either complete or under way.--------          The Howitzers, radar systems, small drones and other weaponry are tailored to the needs of the fight----          as it begins to unfold in the open terrain in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, the official said.--------          "We're trying to send them systems that will help them with the fight in the Donbas," the official said,----          "but that don't require such an onerous training regimen that you have to take fighters out of the fight----          for too long."--------          The Ukrainians have continually sought more and bigger weapons systems, including jet fighters and----          more advanced drones. They also have called for the U.S. and allies to maintain a no-fly zone over----          Ukraine, which Washington has rejected as potentially leading to direct conflict with Moscow.--------          The Ukraine aid garnered broad bipartisan support in Congress, but Republicans have urged----          Democrats to keep it separate from other spending priorities, such as a package funding Covid-19----          vaccines and treatments, which has been stalled by a dispute over border policy.--------          The president—asked if he wanted the Democratic majority in Congress to combine the two funds in a----          single spending bill—said he was agnostic. "I don't care how they do it," he said.--------          Democrats would like to combine the two requests. However, Republicans have insisted that any----          pandemic aid that moves through Congress must also include a vote sustaining Title 42, which allows----          Border Patrol agents to quickly turn away migrants at the southern border. Some Democrats have----          sided with Republicans in calling for a vote on Title 42, making the issue delicate for Democratic----          leadership.--------          "It's enough for now," said Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) of the Ukraine aid request. Asked if it would be----          combined with Covid-19 aid, he said it should be done in a way that would help it pass quickly.--------          Lawmakers didn't indicate that the emergency aid would need to be tied to any revenue generation.--------          "I'd like to pay for some of it, but this is truly an emergency and we've got a chance to deliver a decisive----          blow for freedom," said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), noting he was glad to see Mr. Biden send the----          request to Congress.--------          In addition to the funding request, Mr. Biden is asking Congress to approve a legislative package----          targeting Russian oligarchs, including a measure that would allow forfeited funds to be used to help----          Ukraine.--------         Proposals in the package include creating a criminal offense by making it unlawful for a person to----         knowingly possess proceeds obtained from corrupt dealings with the Russian government; allowing for----         the forfeiture of property that Russian oligarchs use to evade sanctions; adding sanctions evasion to----         the definition of "racketeering activity" under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,----         or RICO; and extending the statute of limitations to pursue money laundering prosecutions from five----         years to 10 years.--------         "This package of proposals will establish new authorities for the forfeiture of property linked to Russian----         kleptocracy, allow the government to use the proceeds to support Ukraine, and further strengthen----         related law enforcement tools," a White House fact sheet says.--------         Mr. Biden's remarks came as Russia has moved to cut off natural-gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.----         The president said both countries had gas reserves, and he has been in touch with U.S. allies to divert----         supplies to the two nations.--------         Natalie Andrews, Gordon Lubold and Alex Leary contributed to this article.--------         Write to Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com--------         Biden Asks Congress for $33 Billion to Support Ukraine--------CO       uscong : United States Congress--------NS       gcat : Political/General News | gdev : Development/Humanitarian Aid | ghea : Health | gpir :----         Politics/International Relations | gpol : Domestic Politics | gvcng : Legislative Branch | gvio : Military----         Action | ncolu : Columns | gsars : Novel Coronaviruses | gweap : Weapons Programs | gcns :----         National/Public Security | gcold : Respiratory Tract Diseases | gdef : Armed Forces | gdip : International----         Relations | gmed : Medical Conditions | grisk : Risk News | gspox : Infectious Diseases | gvbod :----         Government Bodies | ncat : Content Types----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | usa : United States | eurz : Europe | namz : North America | uk : United Kingdom | usdc----         : Washington DC | uss : Southern U.S. | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern----         Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      G/CNG--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220428ei4s0040h------------------------HD         The Ukraine Crisis: Retired Marine Is Released in Exchange for a Russian Prisoner--------BY         By Ann M.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----           Trevor Reed, a U.S. citizen and retired Marine who has been detained in Russia since 2019, was----           released in a prisoner swap in a move lauded by Washington at a time when relations between the----           countries are at a historic low.--------           Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Mr. Reed was exchanged for Russian----           citizen Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2010 for conspiracy to----           smuggle cocaine into the U.S.--------TD----           The release of Mr. Reed, a student at the University of North Texas, who in 2020 was sentenced to----           nine years in prison after being found guilty of assaulting two police officers, comes as Russia stands----           at odds with the U.S. and Europe over its invasion of Ukraine.--------           President Biden praised the release. "We welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the----           family that missed him dearly," he said.--------           Mr. Reed was found guilty of using violence against government officials and was ordered to pay----           each officer 100,000 rubles, equivalent to about $1,378, at the time.--------           Officials at the U.S. State Department said talks to win Mr. Reed's release unfolded over months,----           starting well before Moscow's broad invasion of Ukraine in February.--------           "It took a very, very long time. The highest levels of government were involved. Like the absolute top,----           said Alexey Tarasov, a Houston-based lawyer who represents Mr. Yaroshenko.--------           The Reed family praised Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and----           governor of New Mexico who has advocated on behalf of Mr. Reed and Paul Whelan, another retired----           Marine, of Novi, Mich., who was found guilty of espionage and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in----           prison in a case that also drew U.S. condemnation.--------           Mr. Whelan, who holds U.S., U.K., Canadian and Irish citizenship, maintains his innocence.--------           A senior administration official said the "discussions with the Russians that led to this exchange were----           strictly limited to these topics, not a broader diplomatic conversation."--------           Mr. Reed's lawyer, Sergey Nikitenkov, said in a phone call Wednesday that the "fact of the exchange----           does not mean that he agreed with something, signed something about guilt or asked that he wants----           to be pardoned or repent of something," he said. "He considers himself innocent."--------           Mr. Nikitenkov said Mr. Reed's mood and reaction to his release was mixed. On one hand he is "a----           person who was kept in harsh conditions. . .he was ill there repeatedly. . .his physical condition is----           difficult," the lawyer said. But on the other hand, "of course, yes, he is happy."--------           Mr. Yaroshenko, a 53-year-old pilot from Rostov-on-Don, in Russia's south, was arrested in Liberia----           by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and local police. He was flown to the U.S. and charged----           with conspiring to transport South American cocaine from Liberia to the U.S. He was convicted in----           Manhattan federal court and sentenced to 20 years.--------           On Friday, Russia and the U.S. completed a deal to exchange the two detainees, Mr. Tarasov said.----           Attorneys for both prisoners confirmed that the swap took place in a third country.--------           Even after the deal was brokered, Mr. Yaroshenko remained circumspect, his lawyer said. "After 12----           years of incarceration, you'll always take things with a grain of salt," Mr. Tarasov said. He was----           "cautiously optimistic."--------           A senior U.S. administration official told reporters Wednesday that Mr. Yaroshenko has "already paid----           a steep price in the U.S. justice system," adding that he currently is in Russian custody.--------           Mr. Yaroshenko plans to rejoin his wife, Viktoria, in Rostov-on-Don, his lawyer said.--------           -----------           Corrections & Amplifications--------           -----------           Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan served in the Marines.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----                    President Biden sent Congress a $33 billion request to fund more weapons and provide----                    longer-term economic assistance for Kyiv, as Russia's military is gradually seizing more----                    territory in Ukraine's east, pushing south from the city of Izyum with the apparent aim of----                    cutting off Ukrainian forces.--------                    Mr. Biden said Thursday that the $13.6 billion in funding that Congress had initially provided----                    to Ukraine to help cover the first two months of the war was nearly depleted and that far----                    more was needed, describing the conflict as being at a pivotal point.--------TD----                    The push for more Ukraine aid has garnered broad bipartisan support in Congress and----                    signals how the U.S. and its European allies are preparing for a longer war that could grind----                    on for months.--------                    Thursday's proposal, as described by administration officials, includes $20.4 billion in----                    military and security aid. It comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed a swift----                    response to any greater Western involvement in the conflict.--------                    Russian forces have seized villages south of Izyum in recent days and are gathering for a----                    fresh thrust after Ukraine halted their progress, Ukraine's military said Thursday. Ukrainian----                    and Western officials and analysts say Moscow's progress is slow and has yet to achieve a----                    decisive breakthrough.--------                    Russia at the end of March switched its immediate objectives from taking Kyiv and ousting----                    the elected government to seizing chunks of territory in Ukraine's east. But any success in----                    severing Ukrainian units' supply lines might not be decisive, analysts say, because Russian----                    forces would be vulnerable to Ukrainian counterattacks and face tough urban fighting.--------                    Moscow is seeking a quick advance before Ukraine is able to transfer new and rejuvenated----                    units to the east, bolstered by heavy weapons promised or already delivered by the West,----                    analysts say. Ukrainian officials say Russia is suffering heavy losses.--------                    Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a late-night address that he was grateful to----                    the American people and to Mr. Biden for the request for more aid for his country and that----                    he hoped Congress would act quickly.--------                    "The negative consequences of Russia's aggression against Ukraine and against----                    democracy are so large-scale for the whole world that, in comparison with them, this support----                    from the United States is necessary," Mr. Zelensky said.--------                    Lawmakers in Washington have said that they have been prepared to approve another----                    package of military, humanitarian and economic aid for Ukraine quickly, but that they have------------                    disagreed over whether to tackle Mr. Biden's request on its own, as Republicans want, or----                    combine the Ukraine request with other spending packages, as Democrats prefer.--------                    The House on Thursday approved legislation to create a lend-lease agreement designed to----                    speed up the transfer of military equipment to Ukraine, similar to what the U.S. did with----                    Britain during World War II. The Senate passed the bill earlier this month.--------                    The Pentagon said Wednesday that more than half of the 90 howitzers it recently pledged to----                    Ukraine had been delivered. Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, said that----                    by the end of May, arms would have arrived in sufficient quantities to change the balance of----                    forces on the front.--------                    "By the middle of June…we will be ready to go on the attack," he said in a Ukrainian----                    television interview late Wednesday.--------------------                    An embrace Thursday at a reception point in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, for people displaced by----                    the war.

The weapons will take time to have an effect on the----                    battlefield. Some of the systems are new to Ukrainians and require training and integrating----                    into Kyiv's military. The Pentagon said it had completed howitzer training this week for 50----                    Ukrainians who can pass on the knowledge to teammates.--------                    Russia has quickly thrown together the remnants of units that were decimated in fighting----                    around Kyiv in the first weeks of the war and sent them into fighting in the east. That has left----                    Russian forces there without sufficient logistical and other support, preventing a significant----                    breakthrough, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said Wednesday, describing Russian advances----                    as minor.--------                    "They have not taken enough time to rebuild forces wrecked in fighting around Kyiv," said----                    Frederick Kagan, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank in----                    Washington. "They are hurling them into combat as they become available."--------                    Russian officials say they intend to push Ukrainian forces out of the Donetsk and Luhansk----                    regions in eastern Ukraine, which the Kremlin recognized as independent in February.----                    Moscow says the invasion, which it calls a special military operation, is going according to----                    plan.--------                    Mr. Arestovych, the Ukrainian presidential adviser, said that Russia could achieve further----                    advances where it has concentrated artillery and aerial power for bombardments, but that----------------                    Ukrainian forces were inflicting heavy losses and withdrawing only to take up better----                    defensive positions.--------------------                    A Ukrainian serviceman cleaning his weapon Thursday in a bunker outside Kyiv.

But Russia has made progress striking from Russian territory in the north, where----                    Ukrainian defenses were less prepared.--------                    The Russian advances south of Izyum appear aimed at cutting off Ukrainian troops in the----                    cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. Another Russian advance farther east, toward the city----                    of Lyman, is attempting to encircle the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. Analysts----                    said it was as yet unclear whether Russia would seek a large encirclement of Ukrainian----                    troops or smaller pockets.--------                    But even if they surround Ukrainian units, Russian forces will be vulnerable to----                    counterattacks and would have to pursue urban fighting, in which defenders have a----                    significant advantage. Russia's military surrounded large cities such as Chernihiv in northern----                    Ukraine in March but failed to capture them.--------                    "At a certain point it is possible, but not inevitable, that the Russian will to fight will break,----                    that they will not be able to conduct offensive operations if they continue to take terrible----                    losses," said Mr. Kagan.--------                    Russia's Defense Ministry said Thursday that its forces shot down a Ukrainian Su-24 aircraft----                    near Mykolaivka in eastern Ukraine. It said that Russia's air force struck 67 Ukrainian----                    military facilities over the previous 24 hours and that Russian forces had repelled an attack----                    by Ukrainian forces with Tochka-U missiles and rocket launchers in Russian-held territory in----                    Kherson, in Ukraine's south.--------                    Mr. Zelensky, meanwhile, accused Russia of using what he called energy blackmail to warn----                    European countries off providing further support for Ukraine. Moscow cut off gas supplies to----                    Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday, a move that the Ukrainian leader called a clear----                    demonstration that "no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic----                    cooperation with Russia."--------                    Some European officials have said that Russia's moves against Poland and Bulgaria were----                    intended as a warning against all European Union members sending weapons and----                    ammunition to Ukraine. Germany's Parliament on Thursday approved plans to deliver----                    antiaircraft cannon tanks to Ukraine, ditching its previous reluctance to send heavy----                    weapons.--------                    The EU has vowed to continue phasing out purchases of Russian natural gas, with Germany----                    also now ready to stop buying Russian oil, clearing the way for an EU-wide ban on crude----                    imports from Russia.--------                    In Kyiv, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres met with Mr. Zelensky on----                    Thursday after meeting with Mr. Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in----                    Moscow earlier this week. He said the U.N. would continue to push for a full-scale cease-fire----                    while expanding cash assistance and "striving for immediate practical steps to save lives----                    and reduce human suffering."------------------------                    A return Thursday to a heavily damaged house in Bucha, Ukraine, to retrieve belongings----                    and board up entrances.

The area is now the focus of a----                    war-crimes investigation by the International Criminal Court, though Russia isn't a party to----                    the court and is unlikely to extradite any commanders to stand trial.--------                    "I appeal to the Russian Federation to accept to cooperate with the International Criminal----                    Court," Mr. Guterres said. "But when we talk about war crimes, we cannot forget that the----                    worst of crimes is war itself."--------                    Ukrainian authorities on Thursday filed criminal charges against 10 Russian soldiers----                    accused of taking civilians hostage and mistreating them in Bucha, in the first such move by----                    prosecutors investigating possible war crimes.--------                    All were noncommissioned officers and privates from Russia's 64th Separate Guards Motor----                    Rifle Brigade, one of the units that took part in the monthlong occupation of the Kyiv suburb.----                    Ukrainian authorities said they discovered more than 400 dead civilians after Russian forces----                    retreated in late March, their bodies packed in mass graves or left splayed on streets and----                    sidewalks.--------                    Russia has previously rejected allegations of war crimes, including accusations of targeting----                    civilians.--------                    Georgi Kantchev, Brett Forrest and Ken Thomas contributed to this article.--------                    Write to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.com--------                    Biden Seeks New Aid for Ukraine as Russia Makes Slow Progress in Seizing East--------CO                  uscong : United States Congress--------NS                  gcat : Political/General News | gvio : Military Action | gvexe : Executive Branch | gvbod :----                    Government Bodies | ecat : Economic News | gcrim : Crime/Legal Action | gpir :----                    Politics/International Relations | gpol : Domestic Politics | gvcng : Legislative Branch | gwar :----                    War Crimes | ncolu : Columns | nimage : Images | gweap : Weapons Programs | gcns :----                    National/Public Security | gdef : Armed Forces | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content Types----RE                  ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | russ : Russia | uk :----                    United Kingdom | usa : United States | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric :----                    BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies |----                    eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | namz : North America | weurz : Western Europe----IPD                 Wires--------IPC                 G/CNG--------PUB                 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN                  Document WSJO000020220428ei4s001jl------------------------CLM       Business----SE        Business----HD        U.S. Efforts to Arm Ukraine Shine Light on Limited Production Lines; Years after the U.S.----          stopped buying older weapons, like the Stinger missile, the Pentagon is struggling to replenish----          its stocks----BY        By Doug Cameron and Gordon Lubold----WC        1,598 words----PD        28 April 2022----ET        21:04----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Why or why not? Join the----          conversation below.--------          Military spending is set to rise, with the Biden administration requesting $773 billion for the Pentagon's----          next financial year, but the military is still running short of some weapons widely used in Ukraine.--------          Defense-company executives say they are ready to increase production of most weapons, but some----          experts say the Pentagon has only just begun issuing new contracts that would be required to replace----          some of the weaponry sent overseas.--------          "Industry really can't do a lot until they have their contracts in hand," said Bill Greenwalt, a former----          Pentagon official who managed the military's industrial policy and is now a visiting fellow at the----          American Enterprise Institute in Washington. "We are still in that limbo phase."--------          The Pentagon has sent more than $3.7 billion worth of military goods from existing stockpiles to----          Ukraine since the Feb. 24 invasion, from heavy artillery and tactical drones, to shoulder-fired Stingers----          and Javelins. But so far, the Pentagon has issued only one new contract, for Puma drones. A----          Pentagon official last week said the military was working to get others issued soon.--------          One of the challenges to boosting production is that the military-industrial base is smaller than it once----          was. Years of budget cuts and industry consolidation has left the U.S. with just two producers of missile----          rocket motors. That is down from six in 1995, while the number of companies' sub-suppliers has shrunk----          to 1,000 from about 5,000, according to the Government Accountability Office.--------          Raytheon Technologies Corp., the Pentagon's second-largest supplier and maker of Javelins and----          Stingers, said Tuesday that a rocket motor shortage could stretch into next year.--------          Chief Executive Greg Hayes said the Pentagon hasn't bought new Stingers for almost two decades.----          While it reopened the Stinger production line for an overseas customer last year, it had to redesign----          some parts that are no longer produced.--------         "That's going to take us a little bit of time," said Mr. Hayes on an investor call.--------         Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer under the Trump administration, said the U.S. had----         already sent a quarter of its Stinger stocks to Ukraine. The Pentagon said it has so far earmarked----         around 1,400 Stingers for Ukraine.--------         More on the War in Ukraine--------         Inside the Russian Siege of Mariupol--------         "We have a problem with the government not paying to maintain production capacity," Ms. Lord, now a----         senior adviser at The Chertoff Group, a security risk consultant, said Tuesday at a Congressional----         hearing. It could take two to five years to increase production and replenish supplies being sent to----         Ukraine, she said.--------         Industry representatives say the issues raised by the war in Ukraine and the expected need to surge----         production capacity require the government and Congress to think more broadly about industrial----         strategy.--------         "All of this points to the need to think of the defense industrial base as a capability in and of itself in----         which we need to invest," said Eric Fanning, president and chief executive officer of the Aerospace----         Industries Association, in Arlington Va. "We need to be investing in it in a sustained way so it's there----         when we need it to surge."--------         Bill LaPlante, who started April 15 as the Pentagon's new chief arms buyer, said at a confirmation----         hearing last month that his priority was to speed the flow of supplies to Ukraine and have production----         lines ready to surge output. "I believe we need multiple hot production lines," he said, citing munitions----         and drones.--------         The drawdown of U.S. stockpiles and lack of replacement production has begun to attract the attention----         of lawmakers.--------         Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said last week he was open----         to invoking the Defense Production Act to spur weapons output for Ukraine, reprising the directives that----         helped two years ago to push some defense companies to pivot and produce pandemic-related----         supplies.--------         "The pressure is on," said Mr. Durbin, who added that he was in regular contact on the matter with----         Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.--------         The Pentagon is looking at the Defense Production Act and other legal mechanisms "to determine----         whether they are applicable or prudent, and is applying those authorities as needed to help replenish----         stockpiles in the most efficient manner," said a Pentagon spokeswoman.--------         Speaking Wednesday at the Pentagon, department spokesman John Kirby said that Defense----         Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke about industrial-base issues the previous day with his counterparts at the----         Ukraine Security Consultative Group meeting in Ramstein, Germany. The U.S., Kirby said, is looking at----         its defense industrial base and is also asking allies to look at their own to determine "the degree to----         which there might need to be changes in terms of production of certain systems or not, or accelerations----         or not."--------         To date, almost all the shipments of weapons to Ukraine have come from existing stocks, according to----         the Pentagon. Officials have emphasized that the transfers to Ukraine haven't affected U.S. military----         readiness.--------         Lockheed Martin Corp. said last week that while it was in talks with the Pentagon, it hasn't increased----         production of any of the weapons being sought by Ukraine. Lockheed, the world's largest defense----         company by sales, produces the Javelin in a joint venture with Raytheon.--------         Jay Malave, Lockheed's chief financial officer, said the company was evaluating requests from the----         Pentagon to raise output of equipment, but he did not specify which ones. He said fulfilling the orders----         has been complicated by the pandemic-driven supply chain issues that started to affect defense----         companies in the final quarter of last year—later than most manufacturers.--------         The U.S. has provided Ukraine with more than 5,500 Javelins, but won't doesn't disclose how many are----         left in its inventory. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan think tank,----         estimates the Pentagon has used around a third of its stock.--------         The Pentagon declined to comment on how many Stingers and Javelins were currently in U.S.----         stockpiles.------------         The Defense Department will issue new contracts "as quickly as possible, consistent with existing laws----         and policies," the Pentagon spokeswoman said in a statement.--------         Part of the issue is that while the U.S. has Stingers and Javelins in its arsenal, the weapons are rarely----         used by the U.S. on the battlefield, limiting demand for new ones, officials said. The Pentagon has in----         recent years directed more funding toward higher-end weapons designed to tackle China's military----         expansion often at the expense of older, simpler systems like the Javelin, said industry experts.--------         Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc., which makes rocket motors for the Javelin and Stinger, said it could----         increase production, but was waiting for the Pentagon to order more. The company, which is in the----         midst of a proxy board battle, declined to comment on Raytheon's assertion that industry could take----         months to raise output.--------         Other defense suppliers, such as AeroVironment Inc., which makes the armed Switchblade drones----         being supplied to Ukraine, have cited shortages of high-end semiconductors.--------         At a Senate hearing Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said semiconductor shortages----         were constraining the ability of U.S. military contractors to supply weapons to Ukraine. "I talked to all----         the national defense contractors recently, who are working overtime in the Ukraine replenishment issue----         and their biggest pain point is chips," she said. "There are 250 chips or more in every Javelin launching----         system."--------         The Pentagon, in an apparent nod to concerns about the industrial base, said last week it was----         diversifying its supplies of armed drones being sent to Ukraine, with more than 100 recently developed----         Phoenix Ghosts slated to join the Switchblades already being dispatched.--------         The agency has also reached out to some defense companies to discuss boosting production. On April----         12, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks alongside Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter----         convened a meeting of top defense-industry CEOs to discuss the issue.--------         Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing Co., Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics Corp. L3Harris----         Technologies Inc., and the U.S. arm of BAE Systems PLC were among those who attended, according----         to the Pentagon.--------         David Berteau, chief executive of the Professional Services Council, an Arlington, Va., trade----         association representing government contractors, said at a congressional hearing Tuesday that efforts----         should have been made six years ago to prime the missile supply chain.--------         "We're behind," said Mr. Berteau, a former Pentagon official in charge of logistics during the Obama----         administration, "and you guys should push them."--------         Yuka Hayashi contributed to this article.--------         Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com and Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.com--------         U.S. Efforts to Arm Ukraine Shine Light on Limited Production Lines--------IN       iaer : Aerospace/Defense | idef : Defense Equipment/Products | iindstrls : Industrial Goods--------NS       gvdef : Defense Department | c21 : Output/Production | cpshrt : Product Shortage | cactio : Corporate----         Actions | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | gpir : Politics/International Relations | gvio : Military Action |----         ncolu : Columns | npda : DJ Exclusive Analysis - All | gcat : Political/General News | cexpro :----         Products/Services | gcns : National/Public Security | gpol : Domestic Politics | grisk : Risk News | gvbod----         : Government Bodies | gvexe : Executive Branch | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | usa : United States | eurz : Europe | namz : North America | uk : United Kingdom |----         dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      AJRD--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220428ei4s001p7------------------------CLM      Commodities----SE       Markets----HD       Oil Middlemen Fueled Putin's War Machine. Now They're Getting Out. Russia relies on exporters----         like discreet Swiss firm Trafigura to sell its crude supply, but Ukraine invasion tested even their----         legendary tolerance for risk----BY       By Joe Wallace and Eliot Brown----WC       1,906 words----PD       28 April 2022----ET       22:53----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         Russia built a self-proclaimed fortress around its economy in the run-up to war—but there was a crack.----         Moscow depended on foreign middlemen to ferry its most strategic and lucrative export around the----         world: oil.--------         Now the most-important middleman, Trafigura Group, is joining several competitors in cutting off----         Russian giant Rosneft Oil Co. from global oil markets. In a high-stakes move that goes farther than----         official Western sanctions, the Swiss commodities trader plans to stop exporting Rosneft's crude----         altogether. It will cut its business with the state producer to a sliver of prewar levels, supplying only----         some refined products such as diesel into Europe, according to a spokeswoman.--------TD----         Trafigura and other traders were already poised to lose a big chunk of their Russian business on May----         15, when sanctions go into effect that bar them from selling Rosneft oil to countries outside the----         European Union and Switzerland. In also deciding to cut exports to Europe, long the biggest buyer of----         Russian oil, they are getting ahead of EU countries that are discussing a full ban.--------         Vitol, Trafigura's biggest competitor in oil, also plans to retreat from the Russian market, according to----         people familiar with the decision. Glencore PLC, a mining and trading giant with a long history in----         Russia, suspended its contract to export Rosneft oil in March, people familiar with the decision said.--------         It marks a shift for the traders, which have long done business where few other Western companies----         would dare, given that many of the world's valuable commodities are found in places that have----         struggled with corruption, instability and war.--------         While the traders continued to ship Russian oil after war broke out, they faced mounting pressures from----         Western governments, financial institutions and Ukrainian officials. A huge drop in European demand,----         given the stigma of sending petrodollars to Moscow, made the decision easier.--------         "The world has changed," said Jean-François Lambert, a consultant to the commodities industry and----         former head of commodities trade finance at HSBC. "We are not in a twilight situation. We are in a----         black-and-white situation."--------         Their disengagement is forcing Russia to hastily rework its commodity-export business, the foundation----         of the country's economic wealthand the feedstock for Vladimir Putin's war machine. Rosneft accounts----         for about a third of Russia's total oil production and about a fifth of the government's revenues.--------         The retreat will also likely mean substantial losses on investments the traders made in the country as----         they sought to deepen their roots, such as a giant drilling project in the Arctic Circle partly owned by----         Trafigura and Vitol. On the core business of trading, the merchants face risks as they pull out, as a----         messy unwinding from Russia could stick them with millions of barrels of unsalable oil if they aren't----         adroit.----------------         Trafigura, like many traders, is privately held and offers less disclosure about its operations and----         financial results than public companies. Owned by its 1,000-odd partners, it competes with the likes of----         Vitol and Geneva-based Gunvor Group as well as the trading arms of oil producers including BP PLC----         and Shell PLC.--------         Headed by Australian Chief Executive Jeremy Weir, the firm is legally based in Singapore, though its----         top executives operate out of a bland seven-story office building in Geneva with a pharmacy on the----         ground level.--------         The company generates almost twice as much revenue as Facebook owner Meta Platforms. It churned----         out a profit of $3.1 billion in the year through last September.--------         Last month, Trafigura announced it had doubled the size of a credit facility with banks to more than $2----         billion to weather extreme price moves sparked by the war in Ukraine. A set of Trafigura bonds issued----         late last year have fallen nearly 10% since just before the start of the war. Bonds of other commodity----         traders fell in price, too.--------         Trafigura dates back to a bust-up in 1993 at Marc Rich & Co., run by trader and fugitive from U.S.----         justice Marc Rich. Trafigura—a name plucked from a selection of registered Dutch companies—struck----         out as a breakaway and expanded under founder Claude Dauphin.--------         Post-Soviet Russia was a highly sought-after prize. The country emerged from the collapse of the----         Soviet Union as a commodities superstore. It is the world's biggest exporter of oil and a huge producer----         of natural gas, wheat, nickel, gold and more besides.--------         Together Trafigura and its competitors have channeled billions of dollars to Rosneft from Western----         lenders and invested in oil fields and port terminals in Russia—to endear themselves to producers in----         the country and gain access to their oil, current and former industry executives say.--------         Trafigura was late to the game in Russia, lagging Vitol, Glencore and others. It got its break in 2013----         when it struck a $1.5 billion deal with Rosneft that followed a $10 billion deal between the Russian----         producer and those rivals.--------         The money helped fund Rosneft's purchase of TNK-BP, a bumper deal that turned the state-aligned----         company into the world's biggest listed oil producer. Mr. Dauphin hired away TNK's top traders, gaining----         access to Russian business circles that Trafigura had previously lacked. Israeli-Canadian trader----         Jonathan Kollek—who had spent more than two decades working in Russian oil, starting at Marc Rich----         & Co., according to former colleagues—led Trafigura's new outfit in Moscow.--------         Trafigura didn't make Mr. Kollek available for an interview.--------         The relationship between Rosneft and Trafigura grew stronger after Russia's 2014 annexation of----         Crimea. Rosneft was in a pinch. It faced a wall of debt and sanctions imposed after the annexation----         banned Western banks from making loans that lasted longer than 30 days.--------         Trafigura, armed with a giant balance sheet and with ready access to financing from Western banks----         and the global bond market, swooped in. It agreed to buy oil in huge quantities and pay 25 days up----         front, easing the cash crunch at Rosneft. Trafigura catapulted above Vitol and Glencore to become the----         biggest Western exporter of Russian crude in 2015.--------         "There's no sanctions on oil trading in Russia, and therefore it's business as usual," said Mr. Weir at the----         time.--------         Trafigura went on to deepen its ties with Russia, striking deals beyond trading. It bought an Indian oil----         refinery with Rosneft. And it plowed the equivalent of $8.4 billion into Rosneft's vast Vostok Arctic oil----         field in return for more barrels and a 10% stake in the project, largely funded by a Russian bank.--------         Rosneft—which counts a Russian state-owned company as its largest shareholder—is run by CEO Igor----         Sechin, a close ally of President Putin. Mr. Sechin's strategy was to grant barrels of oil in return for----         funding and investments, all the while playing Trafigura, Vitol and Glencore off against each other, said----         Mr. Lambert, the former banker. "If the price is you invest one billion here, one billion there and you can----         afford it, you do it," he said.--------         Physical commodity markets are opaque. But data tracking shipments from Russian ports and----         calculations by rival companies suggest Trafigura grew to be by far the biggest exporter of Rosneft oil.----         Last year, it shipped about 519,000 barrels a day, according to oil-tracking firm Petro-Logistics, more----         than twice as much as second-place Gunvor. Including oil from private Russian energy companies,----------------         Trafigura was the second-biggest exporter of Russian oil behind Litasco, the trading arm of----         Moscow-based producer Lukoil, the data show.--------         A Trafigura spokeswoman called the data "materially incomplete and inaccurate" but declined to----         provide the company's own figures.--------         When Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Trafigura's big Russian bet began to boomerang.--------         Details of agreements between Trafigura and Rosneft aren't disclosed. But people familiar with their----         terms say Trafigura, and its rivals, agree to long-term contracts to buy millions of barrels of Russian oil----         with prices set according to formulas based on recent prices of oil benchmarks.--------         Russia locks in a steady buyer of its oil, and Trafigura makes a profit by selling the oil at a slightly----         higher price to refiners and traders in Europe and Asia.--------         That recipe came undone when Russia invaded Ukraine. Global markets for Russia's flagship Urals----         crude tanked, selling at roughly a $30 a barrel discount compared with Brent, the international----         benchmark. It usually sells for around the same amount.--------         Trafigura and the other middlemen struggled to find companies to sell to, particularly in the West. "Not----         many," Mr. Weir said at a conference in late March when asked how many buyers there were for----         Russian oil.--------         They found takers farther afield. Cargoes that once headed to Europe instead traveled to markets such----         as India, which has avoided denouncing the war and scooped up Russian oil on the cheap.--------         Share your thoughts--------         Should the West impose a full ban on Russian imports? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.--------         Unlike oil giant BP, which rapidly declared its intent to quit Russia in the days after the invasion,----         Trafigura and some other traders were more circumspect. Trafigura froze its investment in----         Vostokwithout detailing what that entailed, and industry executives expect the company to absorb a----         large loss on the project.--------         After a dialogue with European government officials and external lawyers about EU and Swiss----         sanctions targeting Rosneft, Trafigura decided to stop selling oil from the state company elsewhere in----         the world beyond May 15, even though it theoretically could have skirted the sanctions by operating----         through offshore units.--------         Even sales in Europe turned dicey, as numerous refiners and government officials on the continent----         balked at the thought of buying Russian oil.--------         With few takers, Trafigura could have been stuck buying oil from Russia based on its contract with----         Rosneft with nowhere to sell it.--------         France and other countries are urging a more sweeping ban on Russian oil that would halt sales in the----         EU, too. Meanwhile, staff at some ports are unwilling to unload shipments.--------         With the walls closing in on the traders, Moscow will have to turn elsewhere if it is to keep selling its oil.----         One option is to sell directly to select customers in Asia. Another is to build new pipelines to transport----         oil directly to China. A third is to replace Trafigura and others with smaller traders in the Middle East.--------         Smaller companies might be able to dance around the sanctions, for example by dealing out of----         non-European subsidiaries. But the big players likely can't risk undermining their relationships with----         banks by flouting the spirit of the rules, lawyers and traders say.--------         Rosneft is dashing to sell oil while it still can, and struggling. In recent days, the state producer failed to----         find buyers for tens of millions of barrels of crude it put up for saleafter the traders began to leave----         Russia.--------         Alistair MacDonald contributed to this article.--------         Write to Joe Wallace at Joe.Wallace@wsj.com and Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com--------         Oil Middlemen Fueled Putin's War Machine.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----             The West has leveled waves of sanctions against the Russian economy. The crucial question is,----             are they working?--------             Russia on Wednesday released inconsistent data that showed the economy in March was either----             doing fine or just treading water. Private-sector data has shown a sharp slowdown in Russia.--------TD----             Economists had expected the first official Russian numbers on the economic impact of the invasion----             of Ukraine and the sanctions to show declines in economic growth and industrial output and a----             pickup in unemployment.--------             Russia's Ministry of Economic Development said on Wednesday that the country's economic output----             was 1.6% higher in March than a year earlier. That is a sharp deceleration from the 4.3%----             expansion recorded inFebruary, and the 5.8% growth in gross domestic product seen in January,----             TASS, the state-owned news agency, reported.--------             The country's official statistics agency, known as Rostat, published more positive data, saying----             factory output was just 1% lower in March than in February when seasonal variations in activity are----             accounted for. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1%, Rostat said.--------             It may be too soon for the impact of the war and sanctions to be reflected in the economic data.----             The numbers may also be less reliable than in the past, as Russia looks to clamp down on the view----             the outside world has on its economy.--------             Liam Peach, an economist with Capital Economics, said some of the data appeared to diverge from----             nonofficial measures of economic output. "Such a mild contraction in industrial production seems----             inconsistent with the expected hit from the imposition of Western sanctions last month," he said. He----             noted that private-sector manufacturing surveys showed a sharp decline for March.--------             A measure of private-sector activity in March based on a survey of 500 businesses by S&P Global----             recorded the sharpest fall since May 2020, when Russia was in the early stages of the Covid-19----             pandemic.--------             Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24, prompting governments to impose a punishing series of----             sanctions intended to weaken Russia's capacity to wage war. The sanctions imposed in the early----             weeks of the invasion aimed to sever many of Russia's links to the global financial system and limit----             its access to international logistics and transport networks.--------             On Wednesday, Russia halted natural-gas deliveries to European Union members Poland and----             Bulgaria in retaliation against those sanctions. The stakes are high for the Russian economy since----             oil and gas sales make up more than 40% of the federal budget and Europe is Russia's main gas----             market. Russia's oil production this year may decline by as much as 17% in volume terms because----             of Western sanctions, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Wednesday.--------             Russian policy makers, including President Vladimir Putin, have acknowledged that the sanctions----             have caused economic harm, but haven't publicly quantified the scale of the damage with hard--------             data. International economists have a range of estimates, with the International Monetary Fund----             expecting to see a decline in gross domestic product of 8.5% this year.--------             "This will be the deepest economic crisis since the early '90s," said Vasily Astrov, a Russia-focused----             economist at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies.--------             There are clear signs the economy has been shaken. Job recruiters have seen hiring plummet as----             foreign businesses lay off workers. Businesses have struggled to export goods and source parts for----             operations, while consumers grapple with inflation.--------             The downturn is Russia's latest in a series of dark times. Russia suffered a collapse in economic----             output following the breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, a government-debt meltdown in----             1998, and a contraction and currency depreciation in 2015 in response to sanctions following----             Russia's annexation of Crimea.--------             Russian factories have struggled to find parts they had previously imported from Western suppliers,----             while seeing their access to foreign buyers cut off by financial and logistics roadblocks.--------             Production of cardboard, the packaging of choice for online commerce, has collapsed by 25% since----             the end of February because of sanctions and a fall in domestic consumption as Western brands----             suspended their work in the country, according to Russia's League of Waste Paper Processors.--------             "Everyone is busy looking for new markets in order to export maximum products," said Aleksey----             Sergeev, chief executive of the organization.--------             Around 650,000 tons of cardboard are sitting idle in warehouses across Russia. That is the----             equivalent of a month-and-a-half of stock, compared with a usual stock level covering seven to 10----             days, Mr. Sergeev said.--------             The data published Wednesday represent a curtailed view into the economy. Russian authorities----             stopped publishing some key figures, including data on government debt, trade flows and oil----             production. Some analysts say the partial blackout is part of an effort to deprive Western----             governments of the information they would need to effectively target new sanctions.--------             The statistics agency had a record of accurately reflecting the ups and downs of the economy in the----             years before the war. It had previously recorded a sharp pickup in inflation during March, reflecting----             the ruble's steep decline in the early weeks of the war and a rush to stockpile essentials by----             households in anticipation of shortages. The ruble, supported byrestrictions on taking money out of----             the country, has since rebounded to its prewar levels. The rise in consumer prices has also slowed.--------             But the long-term effects of the war are still unfurling and the impact on Russia's job market may----             not be felt for months.--------------------             License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------CO           rumedt : Russia Ministry of Economic Development--------NS           ecat : Economic News | c13 : Regulation/Government Policy | gesanc : International Sanctions |----             gtrade : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | nimage : Images | e11 : Economic Performance/Indicators |----             ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | e51 : Trade/External Payments | gcat : Political/General News |----             gdip : International Relations | gpir : Politics/International Relations | ncat : Content Types | nfact :----             Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter------------RE           russ : Russia | ussrz : CIS Countries | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries |----             devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern----             Europe | eurz : Europe----IPC          PIC--------PUB          Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN           Document J000000020220428ei4s0000t------------------------HD        The Ukraine Crisis: Drone Firm Suspends Business In Russia, Ukraine--------BY        By Dan Strumpf----WC        269 words----PD        28 April 2022----SN        The Wall Street Journal----SC        J----PG        A7----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

DJI has said that it never tampered with its products, and that it was trying to fix the----          malfunction problems.--------TD----          DJI didn't say which compliance requirements were behind its decision. The U.S. and its allies have----          imposed export controls and sanctions on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. They include----          a ban on exports to Russia's defense sector and complex restrictions on the export to Russia of----          foreign products made using U.S. equipment, software or blueprints.--------          Although numerous Western firms have publicly condemned the invasion and announced curtailments----          in business in Russia, Chinese companies have been largely silent despite controlling large shares of----          the market for many products.--------          Drones have played an outsize role in the Russia-Ukraine war. Recently, devices from U.S. startups----          increasingly have been used by Ukrainians in search-and-rescue efforts and other aspects of the----          country's defense. That comes after Ukrainian officials raised concerns about Russia's successful use----          of DJI equipment.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          BERLIN—Germany is now ready to stop buying Russian oil, clearing the way for a European Union----          ban on crude imports from Russia, government officials said.--------          Berlin had been one of the main opponents of sanctioning the EU's oil-and-gas trade with Moscow.--------TD----          However on Wednesday, German representatives to EU institutions lifted the country's objection to a----          full Russian oil embargo provided Berlin was given sufficient time to secure alternative supplies, two----          officials said.--------          The German shift increases the likelihood that EU countries will agree on a phased-in embargo on----          Russian oil, with a decision possible as soon as next week, diplomats and officials say. However, how----          quickly the bloc ends its Russian oil purchases, and whether it also uses measures such as price caps----          or tariffs, is still being negotiated. The U.S. is pressing its European allies to avoid steps that could----          lead to a protracted increase in oil prices.--------          Europe's debate on banning Russian oil has shifted decisively in recent days with Germany and some----          other countries taking practical steps to replace Russia with other suppliers. Some member states----          remain cautious about the economic impact of an oil embargo, including Hungary, Italy, Austria and----          Greece, diplomats say. All 27 EU governments must approve an oil ban.--------          The oil moves come as EU nations scramble to help member states Poland and Bulgaria make up for----          a natural gas shortfall after Russia stopped deliveries this week in reaction to what it said was the two----          countries' refusal to pay for imports in rubles. The Kremlin demands EU buyers pay into special bank----          accounts where deposits would be converted from euros and dollars into rubles.--------          The EU pays state-controlled Russian firms around €1 billion, equivalent to $1.05 billion, a day for----          energy, according to estimates by Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank. Critics have said that these----          funds are bankrolling Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime and its war in Ukraine.--------          On Thursday, Gazprom PJSC, Russia's biggest gas producer, said profit soared in 2021 on the back----          of higher gas and oil prices.--------          Senior officials from EU member states discussed oil sanctions at length on Wednesday and the----          European Commission, the EU's executive body, will hold further discussions with EU countries in----          coming days before presenting a proposal probably early next week, officials and diplomats say.--------          U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last week that a full European oil embargo on Russia would----          push up international oil prices, hurting a fragile global economy, and might "actually have very little----          negative impact on Russia," which would benefit from higher oil prices on its remaining exports. She----          suggested Europe could keep buying oil while restricting Russia's access to payments, echoing talk in----          Europe of making payments into an escrow account.----------------          The EU imports between 3 million and 3.5 million barrels of oil a day from Russia, sending just under----          $400 million in payments daily, according to Bruegel. That amounts to some 27% of EU oil imports. Oil----          and gas revenues accounted for 45% of Russia's federal budget in 2021, according to the International----          Energy Agency.--------          Many companies have been self-sanctioning, according to analysts and traders, avoiding trade in----          Russian oil over reputational concerns and the risk that the Western pressure campaign could soon----          encompass Moscow's energy exports. That is already contributing to a sharp fall in Russian oil----          exports, according to the IEA.--------          EU officials designing the next sanctions proposals have to factor in that it will take some European oil----          refineries time to adapt to receive non-Russian crude. They also acknowledge that for countries such----          as landlocked Hungary, which receives its Russian oil through pipelines, adjusting to a Russian oil----          embargo will be complex.--------          The bloc is considering the option of combining a gradual phaseout of oil purchases with more----          immediate measures to reduce demand or cut payments to Moscow, such as a price cap or a tariff on----          oil imports. Another possibility is to phase out shipped oil purchases quickly and pipeline deliveries----          more slowly.--------          "There are all sorts of things that we're running through," said a senior EU official. "The aim is to hit the----          Russians as hard as possible while at the same time minimizing" the cost.--------          While Germany has swung behind the idea of phasing out Russian oil purchases, Berlin remains----          skeptical of price caps, tariffs and proposals to put Russia's oil payments into escrow accounts.--------          German officials doubt that Mr. Putin would maintain oil deliveries if the EU unilaterally cut the price it----          pays, and they caution that Russia could easily sell its oil to other customers such as India and China----          instead of accepting a lower European price.--------          Berlin's change of mind on oil came after it struck a deal with Poland that will enable Germany to----          import oil from global exporters via the Baltic Sea port of Gdansk, officials said Wednesday.--------          The Polish port is located close to the PCK oil refinery in Schwedt, Germany, which is controlled by the----          Russian oil giant Rosneft and receives crude via a Russian pipeline known as Druzhba, Russian for----          friendship.--------          The Gdansk port infrastructure, which is equipped to receive oil supertankers, is connected to the----          Russian pipeline with a separate link operated by Poland. This means oil imports to Gdansk could be----          immediately channeled through the pipeline to the Schwedt refinery, replacing Russian supplies,----          government officials said.--------          The Schwedt refinery was the biggest obstacle to Germany accepting a ban on Russian oil imports----          because thousands of jobs in the region depend on it and there was no alternative supply to feed it----          until now, the officials said.--------          The Polish deal was necessary because the German port closest to the refinery, Rostock, doesn't----          have the capacity to receive supertankers. In addition, Germany's railways no longer operate oil----          wagons. The landmark deal was announced on Wednesday by German Economy Minister Robert----          Habeck during a visit to Poland.--------          Some 12% of Germany's oil consumption relies on Russian imports, down from 35% before the war,----          Mr. Habeck said in a video statement posted on his ministry's social media. He said Germany was now----          ready for the possibility that Rosneft would stop channeling oil, a scenario he said would no longer----          spell disaster for the German economy.--------          "Rosneft is a Russian state company and they have no interest in processing non-Russian oil," Mr.----          Habeck said.--------          Should Rosneft refuse to process non-Russian oil imports, Germany could put the refinery under state----          management under laws protecting strategic assets. Berlin has already assumed stewardship of the----          main Russian gas-trading hub in Germany, a subsidiary of Russia's state-controlled Gazprom.--------          Write to Bojan Pancevski at bojan.pancevski@wsj.com, Laurence Norman at----          laurence.norman@wsj.com and Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com--------          Germany Drops Opposition to Embargo on Russian Oil----------------CO        brglcb : Brussels European and Global Economic Laboratory | euruno : European Union--------IN        i1 : Energy | ifosfl : Fossil Fuels | i1300003 : Crude Petroleum Extraction | i13 : Crude Oil/Natural Gas----          Upstream Operations | iextra : Natural Gas/Oil Extraction----NS        gtrade : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | gesanc : International Sanctions | c314 : Pricing | c13 :----          Regulation/Government Policy | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | e51 : Trade/External Payments |----          ecat : Economic News | gdip : International Relations | gpir : Politics/International Relations | gpol :----          Domestic Politics | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News | c31 : Marketing | ncat : Content----          Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter----RE        russ : Russia | gfr : Germany | eecz : European Union Countries | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia |----          eurz : Europe | uk : United Kingdom | ukrn : Ukraine | ussrz : CIS Countries | weurz : Western Europe |----          apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | dach : DACH Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----          Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe----IPD       WSJ--------IPC       GAZP.RS--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220428ei4s003ux------------------------CLM      Commodities----SE       Markets----HD       Corn and Soybeans Near Record Prices, Push Food Costs Higher; Ukraine war, drought in----         South America and biofuel demand pressure supplies of the crops----BY       By Ryan Dezember----WC       873 words----PD       29 April 2022----ET       00:51----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         Corn and soybeans prices have risen nearly to records, signaling higher food inflation to come.--------         Global food prices had already reached records when Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and----         jeopardized big slices of the world's grain and oilseed supplies. Poor harvests in South America,----         inclement planting weather in the U.S. and rising biofuel demand threaten to stretch inventories even----         thinner and push prices higher.--------TD----         The price of soybeans, which are fed to cows, chicken and salmon and crushed into oils, has gained----         26% so far this year. Futures are trading above $17 a bushel for the first time since a hot, dry summer----         baked American farms and ruined crops in 2012. Until recently, that drought a decade ago was the only----         time that corn cost more than $8 a bushel. Corn futures, up 37% this year, traded as high as $8.24 on----         Thursday, about 15 cents shy of the all-time high.--------         If corn and soybeans notch new highs, they will be the latest raw materials to do so in the broadest and----         sharpest commodities rally of the modern trading era. Vegetable oils, oats and wheat already reached----         records in 2022.--------         Corn is more than twice as expensive as before the pandemic and in most years without drought.----         Soybeans have nearly doubled their typical price, too.--------         The rise in these key ingredients is spilling over into the cost of producing foods ranging from pork----         chops to Pepsi, eating away at Americans' purchasing power and adding another challenge to the----         postpandemic economic recovery.--------         Food companies say shoppers have so far kept up. But analysts say there are signs, such as stronger----         private-label sales, that show consumers are responding to the pinch.--------         "The elasticities that we're having in the business are better than historical and better than what we had----         planned," PepsiCo Inc. Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta told investors on a call this week. "However,----         we think the consumer is very early in this process of adjusting to the new inflationary environment."--------         U.S. food prices in March were up 8.8% from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.----         A United Nations group said global food prices hit a new high last month, and the World Bank said it----         expects war in Europe to boost food prices about 23% this year, after a 31% climb in 2021 when----         snarled supply chains and bad weather jolted agricultural commodity markets.--------         The Federal Reserve responded last month with its first interest-rate increase in more than three years,----         lifting the benchmark rate to a range between 0.25% and 0.5% and penciling in additional hikes. Many----         expect the central bank to raise rates another half-percentage point next week.--------         The Biden administration doesn't anticipate food shortages at home and is directing aid abroad to----         places that might run low, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday.------------         "We're really conducting extensive diplomacy to encourage all countries to refrain from export----         restrictions and excessive stockpiling," she said. "It would exacerbate supply-chain challenges and----         price inflation."--------         Ukraine is a major corn exporter, and there are doubts that much will be planted amid the fighting, or----         that bushels will make it to international markets following harvest. The U.S. Agriculture Department----         has lowered its projections for Ukraine's corn exports by about 30% since Russia invaded.--------         Soybean gains have been driven lately by Brazil's severe drought and record temperatures, which----         threaten to shrink the biggest bean grower's crop.--------         Drought is a worry in North America, too, because of the La Niña weather pattern. But currently it is----         cold, wet weather that is delaying planting in the Midwest. Just 7% of this year's corn was planted by----         the start of the week, compared with 16% a year ago, the Agriculture Department said. Soybeans are----         similarly behind schedule.--------         This year is expected to be just the third on record in which U.S. farmers plant more land with soybeans----         than with corn. Soaring fertilizer prices are behind the shift. Legumes fix nitrogen in the soil and don't----         need the nutrient added like corn does.--------         BofA Securities analysts say one way to boost food supplies would be for governments to cut rules----         mandating that biofuels made from crops be blended into gasoline and diesel.--------         The Biden administration eased summer smog rules to allow higher blends of corn-made ethanol, an----         effort to tame prices at the pump. Oil producers, environmental groups and meat companies that feed----         their animals corn were displeased.--------         The analysts forecast the U.S. will use about five times as much corn to make motor fuels this year----         than Ukraine typically exports in total.--------         "For wealthy countries, the pressure on food supply created by biofuel blending may seem tolerable,----         but lower-income countries would realize greater food inflation relief from even small reductions in----         blending," the BofA analysts wrote in a research note last week.--------         Write to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com--------         Corn and Soybeans Near Record Prices, Push Food Costs Higher--------IN       i0100223 : Soybean Farming | i0 : Agriculture | i1 : Energy | ialtful : Alternative Fuels | i010013205 :----         Corn Farming | i01001 : Farming | i0100132 : Oilseed/Grain Farming----NS       mcorn : Corn Markets | gdroug : Drought | gntdis : Natural Disasters/Catastrophes | gvio : Military----         Action | m14 : Commodity Markets | magric : Soft Commodity Markets | mcat : Commodity/Financial----         Market News | mgroil : Grains/Edible Oils Markets | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News |----         moilsd : Oilseed Markets | gcns : National/Public Security | gdis : Disasters/Accidents | grisk : Risk----         News | gwea : Weather | m141 : Agricultural Commodity Markets | mgrain : Grain Markets | ncat :----         Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfce : C&E Exclusion Filter----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | usa : United States | eurz : Europe | namz : North America | russ : Russia | uk : United----         Kingdom | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz :----         Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | ussrz : CIS Countries | weurz : Western----         Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      G/AGD--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220428ei4s0012y------------------------CLM       Risk & Compliance Journal----SE        C Suite----HD        Russia Sanctions Complicate Paying Ransomware Hackers; An ever-increasing array of U.S.----          sanctions levied against Russia have made the already difficult problem of how to resolve----          ransomware attacks more thorny----BY        By Richard Vanderford----WC        894 words----PD        28 April 2022----ET        15:00----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          The nearly nonstop series of new U.S. sanctions being levied in a bid to halt Russia's war machine----          have complicated events for companies facing their own external threat: ransomware attacks.--------          The ever-lengthening lists of sanctioned entities pose risks to U.S. companies that want to pay to get----          their systems back online after an attack, experts said.--------TD----          Ed McNicholas, co-leader of the cybersecurity practice at law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, said ensuring----          that ransomware payments aren't going to sanctioned Russian entities has gotten "much harder"----          recently.--------          "The overlap of the rise of ransomware and then these pervasive sanctions against Russia has----          created quite a firestorm in terms of the ability to pay ransoms," he said.--------          Traditionally, the list of entities under sanction has been mostly relevant to those in financial services,----          but recent surges in ransomware attacks have meant that cybersecurity experts have had to do their----          best to ensure ransom payments aren't going to blacklisted entities.--------          The work of staying up to date has become more intense as the U.S. has steadily piled on sanctions,----          said Bill Siegel, the chief executive of Coveware Inc., which helps companies handle negotiations and----          other work associated with attempts at cyber extortion.--------          "With the war, it's become incredibly dynamic where the entire landscape can shift or change when----          you wake up in the morning," Mr. Siegel said. "There's more sanctions happening every single day."--------          U.S. law imposes so-called strict liability on anyone that makes a payment to a sanctioned----          entity—meaning that a lack of intent to flaunt sanctions doesn't exonerate the paying party.--------          So far, U.S. enforcers haven't publicly targeted a company for making a ransomware payment to a----          sanctioned entity, but several experts have said some kind of enforcement activity is likely.--------          The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and its Financial Crimes----          Enforcement Network both have highlighted ransomware payments in recent months. OFAC said in----          September that it "strongly discourages" extortion payments and reiterated that it can take action----          against payers.--------          "It is likely that OFAC will seek to make an example," said Matt Lapin, a partner at the law firm Porter----          Wright Morris & Arthur LLP who specializes in international transactions and international trade law.--------          Mr. Lapin said he thought OFAC would most likely take action against a ransomware-paying company----          that had failed to conduct appropriate due diligence on its payment or failed to proactively----          communicate with law enforcement or OFAC itself.------------          FinCEN in March warned financial institutions to beware of Russia-linked ransomware attacks, and----          OFAC earlier this month sanctioned a "darknet" market and cryptocurrency exchange suspected of----          involvement in ransomware payments.--------          To keep companies from inadvertently running afoul of the law, Coveware runs information collected in----          connection to attacks through a series of analyses, collecting data on behavioral patterns, the code----          used and other forensic artifacts, Mr. Siegel said. The company also tries to ensure that the attacker is----          a financially motivated criminal, rather than a state-linked actor, he said.--------          Coveware refuses to facilitate a payment to a suspected sanctioned entity—anyone involved in----          facilitating a payment to a sanctioned entity can be found liable for violating the law—but has had----          clients ask that it ignore sanctions, Mr. Siegel said.--------          Even absent an enforcement action, the mere possibility of an action by OFAC, which enforces----          sanctions, can be enough to complicate a ransomware payment. Civil penalties could range from----          thousands to millions of dollars.--------          Insurance companies can be reluctant to make payments if there is even a hint of involvement by a----          sanctioned entity, said Roberta Sutton, a partner at Potomac Law Group PLLC whose practice focuses----          on insurance recovery and risk management.--------          After one of Ms. Sutton's clients, a firm she declined to name that provides----          information-technology-related services, made a ransomware payment to release its systems after a----          June 2020 attack, the company hasn't been paid by its insurer, she said. A third-party not involved in----          the investigation wrote an article suggesting the attack might be attributable to a sanctioned entity,----          which led the insurance company to halt the $1 million payment, Ms. Sutton said.--------          "It's so frustrating," she said. "A million dollars is rather large for this client. It's had to call on its----          investors for more capital."--------          The insurance company, which she also declined to name, reached out to OFAC for guidance but----          hasn't yet received a response, she said.--------          Coveware's Mr. Siegel said companies should be proactive about beefing up their security and run----          tabletop exercises to try to avoid being caught off guard by an attack.--------          "Most companies approach this risk for the very first time when the incident happens," he said. "All of a----          sudden, during this horrible incident, the company's down—oh, and by the way, there's this terrible risk----          of this strict liability problem with one of the scariest regulators out there. They're forced to understand----          it under duress."--------          Write to Richard Vanderford at richard.vanderford@wsj.com--------          Russia Sanctions Complicate Paying Ransomware Hackers--------CO        ropgry : Ropes & Gray LLP--------IN        ibcs : Business/Consumer Services | i835 : Legal Services--------NS        gcvir : Malware | gext : Extortion/Blackmail | gesanc : International Sanctions | gcrim : Crime/Legal----          Action | ghack : Cybercrime/Hacking | gpir : Politics/International Relations | ncolu : Columns | gcat :----          Political/General News | gdip : International Relations | gfinc : Financial Crime | ncat : Content Types |----          nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter----RE        russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | namz : North America | usa : United----          States | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging----          Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe----IPD       Wires--------IPC       I/BCS--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220428ei4s00107------------------------CLM                      World News----SE                       World----HD                       Ukraine Brings First War-Crimes Charges Against Russian Soldiers in Bucha;----                         Prosecutors name 10 non-commissioned officers and privates they allege----                         mistreated civilians in the Kyiv suburb----BY                       By Brett Forrest----WC                       774 words----PD                       28 April 2022----ET                       18:39----SN                       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC                       WSJO----LA                       English----CY                       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Omurbekov as part of a----                         group of commanders of front-line units it said had been accused of committing----                         "heinous acts."--------                         The men charged on Thursday allegedly took part in two incidents, prosecutors said.----                         Ukraine accused them of "ill-treatment of civilians, which is a violation of the laws and----                         customs of war under international treaties."--------                         In one instance, residents interviewed by Ukrainian prosecutors said a group of eight----                         privates and corporals, carrying out the orders of a sergeant, rounded up civilians, held----                         them hostage in two locations on Bucha's Anatoly Mikhailovsky Street, and starved----                         and intimidated them.--------------------                         War crimes prosecutor Ruslan Kravchenko examined evidence in Bucha, Ukraine.----                         PHOTO: Serhii Korovayny for The Wall Street Journal--------                         Prosecutors alleged the Russian soldiers bound the hands of captives, struck them----                         with rifle butts and said they would kill them and their family members.--------                         Moscow has denied targeting civilians in its military assault on Ukraine and called----                         video and photographic images from Bucha staged.--------                         In a second case, prosecutors said a Russian sergeant took hostages in a private----                         home on Bucha's Hrushevsky Street. Witnesses told investigators the sergeant forced----                         one man to kneel and, after striking him in the head with a rifle butt, shot at him but----                         missed.

Prices have soared, adding to global food-price----          inflation and heaping misery on developing countries that had been dependent on imports from the----          region.--------TD----          The extent of damage to some farms, together with port disruption and a shortage of fertilizer,----          demonstrates how the war's impact on Ukraine's agriculture industry could extend well into next year.--------          When Russian troops pulled out of areas around Kyiv, they left shattered buildings and were accused----          of war crimes against the local population. Farmers in northern Ukraine say they have returned to----          fields littered with mines, unexploded ordnance and large craters. Several workers have been killed,----          and the work has been placed on hold in some areas, the farmers add.--------          Alex Lissitsa, chief executive of IMC, one of Ukraine's largest agricultural companies, said his workers----          should now be planting sunflowers and corn on 30,000 hectares of land (a hectare is 2.47 acres) north----          of Chernihiv but can't because of unexploded shells and mines.--------          "It looks like this year or even the year after we will not be able to do anything here," Mr. Lissitsa said----          of parts of the land. The company also lost a grain storage facility, a chemicals laboratory and other----          buildings and equipment to Russian shelling.--------          Mr. Lissitsa said he frequently hears of deaths related to mines, adding that a worker on a neighboring----          farm was recently killed when his tractor ran over one.--------          The Ukrainian government estimates that mines are present in around 30% of farm fields in areas----          around Kyiv previously occupied by the Russians.--------          Taras Vysotskyi, Ukraine's deputy minister of agrarian policy and food, said it was clear that the----          targeting of agriculture was deliberate because Russian forces placed mines in fields of no military----          value and continued to do so even as they withdrew. "It was the case of blocking the possibility of----          making agriculture productive again in Ukraine," he said.----------------          The two regions where the retreating Russians set mines and destroyed farm equipment and buildings----          are among the most agriculturally productive in Ukraine, Mr. Vysotskyi added.--------          Russian officials didn't respond to a request for comment about targeting Ukraine's agriculture----          industry. Moscow has previously denied targeting civilians.--------          Despite having been sent photos of damage to his farm near the northern city of Chernihiv, Petro----          Melnyk said he wasn't prepared for the extent of the destruction when he returned over two weeks----          ago.--------          "The Russians specifically want to stop farms," said Mr. Melnyk, the CEO and co-owner of Agricom----          Group, which owns farms across Ukraine. Mr. Melnyk said his properties had been heavily bombed,----          destroying buildings, tractors and other machinery, although no known Ukrainian military positions are----          nearby.--------          To be sure, not all farmers think they were deliberately targeted. Dmitry Skorniakov has found Russian----          mines on parts of his 8,000 hectares in the Sumy and Chernihiv regions but he believes that they were----          intended for the Ukrainian military rather than to hurt agriculture, partly because mines were at the----          edges of fields.--------          Either way, the damage to farming capacity and the continued occupation of farmland in Ukraine's----          east and south is a blow to an industry that provides 10% of global wheat exports, 14% of corn exports----          and about half of the world's sunflower oil, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The World----          Bank recently warned of a global food catastrophe stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.--------          Farmers are waiting for the Ukrainian military to clear the mines and munitions, which could take a----          while. Evgeniy Kharlan, who farms asparagus and blueberries, asked the military to clear unexploded----          munitions on his land close to the front line in eastern Ukraine and was told that clearing cities and----          towns was a higher priority. Mr. Kharlan also said the military told him to avoid his other farm near----          Chernobyl because of the risk posed by mines.--------          The delay in getting back to work likely will reduce the harvest this year and potentially next, Mr.----          Kharlan said, adding that only around 30% to 40% of his fields were now being farmed.--------          The Ukrainian government predicts 25% less land will be planted this spring than usual, though----          several farming companies operating in the country say the projection is too optimistic.--------          Mr. Melnyk said he was confident that he can borrow or rent enough equipment to farm around 80% of----          his 9,000 hectares in the Chernihiv region, and that he already was farming a further 9,000 hectares----          elsewhere. However, he also has 6,000 hectares in the Luganz province in eastern Ukraine that----          Russian forces still control that he has written off farming this year.--------          Even where farmers are working, a lack of fertilizer and chemicals used for crop protection mean that----          yields will likely be lower.--------          Mr. Lissitsa's corn fields would typically yield around 10 metric tons per hectare (a metric ton is 1.1----          tons). "Now, I would be happy with 8 tons a hectare, but it will definitely be less," he said.--------          Some Western companies, including Germany's Bayer AG, have donated seeds to Ukraine. Others,----          including Exxon Mobil Corp., have helped with fuel supplies, a government official said. Farmers say----          they have been able to buy more fuel in recent weeks after an acute shortage hampered their ability to----          plant and to spread fertilizer last month.--------          But Ukraine remains particularly low on fertilizers, which before the war it had bought from Russia and----          Belarus. Ukraine is also struggling to export its produce because Russia has blockaded its Black Sea----          ports or taken control of them. And farmers in some parts of the country have had to contend with----          heavy rain in recent weeks.--------          In the face of the challenges, farmers are racing against the clock. "We should be finished [spring]----          planting by the latest 20th May," Mr. Lissitsa said last week. "We have only 25 days to plant."--------          Write to Alistair MacDonald at alistair.macdonald@wsj.com--------          After Russian Retreat, Ukraine's Farmers Discover Fields Full of Mines--------IN        i01001 : Farming | i0 : Agriculture--------NS        ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | gfdsec : Food/Drinking Water Security | gvio : Military Action | ncolu :----          Columns | ncor : Corrections | ncrx : Corrected Items | npda : DJ Exclusive Analysis - All | gcat :--------          Political/General News | gcns : National/Public Security | gcom : Society/Community | grisk : Risk----          News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters----RE        ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | uk : United----          Kingdom | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging----          Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western----          Europe----IPD       Wires--------IPC       BAYN.XE--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220428ei4s00335------------------------CLM      Essay----SE       Life----HD       Russia's Long Disdain for Ukrainian Nationhood; Even Russian liberals and dissidents have----         traditionally shared Putin's view that Ukraine has no distinct cultural identity.----BY       By Yaroslav Trofimov----WC       1,350 words----PD       28 April 2022----ET       22:27----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         As a young poet in the Soviet Union, Joseph Brodsky was persecuted by the authorities before----         escaping to the U.S. in 1972 and going on to win the Nobel Prize in literature. In Soviet-era Kyiv,----         Ukrainian intellectuals used to trade coveted samizdat reprints of Brodsky's poems, reciting them at----         clandestine gatherings.--------         But the affection wasn't mutual. At a reading in 1992, less than a year into Ukraine's existence as an----         independent nation, Brodsky offered a new poem titled "To the Independence of Ukraine." "Farewell----         khokhols," he intoned, using a racial slur for Ukrainians. "We've lived together, now enough. Wish I----         could spit into the Dnipro river, perhaps it would now flow backwards." Brodsky went on to predict that----         when the ungrateful Ukrainians were wheezing on their deathbeds, they would surely revert to reciting----         the verse of the classic Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin, rather than the "lies" of their own national----         poet, Taras Shevchenko.--------TD----         The idea that Ukrainians aren't a real people and that Ukrainian nationhood is an artificial construct has----         long been mainstream in Russian culture, literature and politics—including among liberal luminaries like----         Brodsky, who died in 1996. President Vladimir Putin's views on Ukraine, which he expounded in an----         essay last year that was read to Russian soldiers preparing for the invasion, are no outlier. They follow----         a lengthy tradition that helps to explain the continuing support for the war among Russia's citizens.--------         This blind spot dates to the beginnings of the modern Ukrainian quest for sovereignty more than a----         century ago. "The Russian democrat ends where the Ukrainian question begins," said Ukrainian writer----         and playwright Volodymyr Vynnychenko, who served as prime minister of the short-lived Ukrainian----         National Republic in 1917-18. It has become one of the best-known phrases in Ukrainian politics.--------         In Russia's historical narrative and literary tradition, Ukrainians have often been depicted as dimwitted----         but good-natured peasants who speak with a funny accent, and whose quest for an independent future----         can only be the product of foreign intrigues. Mikhail Bulgakov, born in Kyiv to parents who had moved----         from Russia, mocked the Ukrainian language in his novels, with one character arguing that Ukrainians----         can't have a word for whale because, unlike Russia, Ukraine doesn't have oceans. Natives of Ukraine----         who achieved undisputed artistic or scientific success, from the painter Kazimir Malevich to the father of----         the Soviet space program, Sergei Korolyov, have been appropriated as Russian.--------         "Many of those in Russia who pretend to be an intellectual elite have a condescending attitude to----         Ukrainians, and this includes many of those in the opposition who are supporting Ukraine now," said----         Russian politician Ilya Ponomarev, the only Russian lawmaker to vote against the annexation of----         Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. "They look at the Ukrainians as a little brother, a brother who still----         needs to grow up."--------        Every Russian, Mr. Ponomarev added, instinctively feels the heritage of the ancient Russian state when----        dismissing Ukraine as a recent invention. It's a view that Mr. Ponomarev himself says he had to----        reassess after emigrating to Ukraine, where he learned that historical figures viewed by Russians as the----        founders of their nation were in fact ruling from Kyiv centuries before Moscow came into existence. One--------         example is Prince Vladimir the Great, the 10th-century ruler who brought Christianity to the realm then----         known as the Kyivan Rus. Both Mr. Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are named after----         him.--------         The tradition of Russian hostility to Ukrainian aspirations comes in two strands. One simply denies the----         existence of Ukrainians as a people distinct from Russians. That was the line adopted by the Russian----         Empire for much of the 19th century, when it banned books in Ukrainian and the very term Ukraine,----         calling the region "Little Russia" instead. Another strand holds that while Ukrainians do in fact have their----         own identity and speak their own language, at least half the territory of present-day Ukraine really----         belongs to Russia and was unfairly pried away by the Soviet Union's founder Vladimir Lenin.--------         That was the view of the Russian novelist and former political prisoner Alexander Solzhenitsyn, another----         Nobel laureate, who was exiled by the Soviets in 1974 and returned to Russia in 1994. He initially----         expressed understanding of Ukrainian suffering. "We should prove the greatness of our nation not by----         the sheer size of our territory and the number of peoples in our care, but by the greatness of our----         actions," he wrote in his 1968 classic, "The Gulag Archipelago," describing encounters with Ukrainian----         political prisoners.--------         But after Ukraine's independence turned from a distant and unlikely prospect to reality, Solzhenitsyn----         adopted a different tone, one that Mr. Putin replicated in his essay last year. In a 2006 interview with----         Moskovskiye Novosti newspaper, Solzhenitsyn argued that southern and eastern Ukraine, the Crimea----         and Donbas have never belonged to historical Ukraine, and that the country was being dragged into----         NATO against the will of the inhabitants of these areas. "Under all these conditions, Russia can under----         no circumstances dare to betray the multimillion Russian population of Ukraine, renounce our unity with----         them," he said.--------         Mr. Putin paid a visit to Solzhenitsyn in his country home in 2007, a year before the novelist's death,----         and gave him one of Russia's highest prizes. Some of the Kremlin's policies, Mr. Putin said at the time,----         were inspired by the writer.--------         In 2014, Mr. Putin seized Crimea after Ukrainian protesters ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian President----         Viktor Yanukovych, who had reversed the country's longstanding policy toward integration with the----         European Union and sought a customs union with Russia. Mr. Putin also promoted the concept of----         Novorossiya, "New Russia," for the regions of southern and eastern Ukraine that he said rightfully----         belong to Moscow.--------         The annexation of Crimea was almost universally applauded in Russia. Even the imprisoned Russian----         opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is now protesting vociferously against Mr. Putin's war on Ukraine,----         said at the time that Crimea should remain part of Russia. "Crimea is not a sausage sandwich to be----         given back," he told a radio interview.--------         Until the invasion began on Feb. 24, Kremlin statements challenged Ukraine's right to govern what Mr.----         Putin described as historic Russian lands in so-called Novorossiya but grudgingly acknowledged the----         existence of a Ukrainian state. According to Russian propaganda, the problem was a Western-installed----         clique that supposedly seized power in 2014, and whose removal would be welcomed by ordinary----         Ukrainians yearning to resume their brotherly kinship with Russia.--------         Once the fierce Ukrainian resistance showed that hardly any Ukrainians greeted Russian soldiers as----         liberators, the tone shifted. Now Russian state media and official discourse argue that Ukraine and its----         culture must be simply wiped out—an idea that explains the killing spree in towns like Bucha during the----         Russian occupation.--------         A commentary published by Russia's RIA state news agency on April 3 under the title "What Russia----         Must Do to Ukraine" argued that ordinary Ukrainians must be made to "atone for the guilt" of hostility to----         Moscow, the name Ukraine should be abolished once again and the country split into several pieces.----         Ukrainian elites should be physically liquidated and the remaining population re-educated and----         "de-Ukrainized."--------         Russia's former president and current deputy national security chief, Dmitry Medvedev, outlined a----         similar vision for the future of Ukraine days later, writing that after the Russian victory, the Ukrainian----         state will disappear just like the Nazi Third Reich. As for the Ukrainians' deep sense of their own----         separate nationhood, Mr. Medvedev explained, "It's a great fake fed by anti-Russian venom and an----         all-encompassing lie about their own identity. It never existed in history and doesn't exist today."--------         Write to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com--------         Russia's Long Disdain for Ukrainian Nationhood------------NS       gvexe : Executive Branch | gcat : Political/General News | gpir : Politics/International Relations | ncat :----         Content Types | ncolu : Columns | gpol : Domestic Politics | gvbod : Government Bodies----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | crimea : Crimea | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | uk----         : United Kingdom | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz :----         Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz :----         Western Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      N/DJN--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220428ei4s005v5------------------------CLM              World News----SE               World----HD               Russia Suffers Another Fire at a Supply Depot as It Advances in Eastern Ukraine; EU----                 leader accuses Moscow of economic blackmail after Russia stops gas flows to Bulgaria----                 and Poland----BY               By James Marson and Ann M.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----                 An ammunition depot caught fire near Russia's border with Ukraine, a local official said, the----                 latest in a series of incidents to afflict Moscow's military facilities in recent weeks that could----                 pressure supply lines to its forces.--------                 The fire at the depot in a village near Belgorod, around 15 miles from the Ukrainian border, was----                 extinguished by early morning Wednesday, according to Vyacheslav Gladkov, the regional----                 governor.--------TD----                 Authorities also reported blasts in Russia's Kursk and Voronezh regions, which are adjacent to----                 Ukraine. The regions' governors said air-defense systems shot down drones in the early hours----                 of Wednesday.--------                 The incidents follow a series of similar events in recent weeks in the regions neighboring----                 eastern Ukraine, where Russia is attempting to seize territory. Russian officials said two----                 Ukrainian helicopters struck an oil-storage facilityon the outskirts of Belgorod on April 1. Fires----                 broke out at two fuel-storage depots in the Bryansk region on Monday.--------                 Russia said the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, the missile cruiser Moskva, sank in a storm after----                 an ammunition explosion on board on April 14, while the U.S. said it was struck by Ukrainian----                 missiles.--------                 Ukrainian officials have hinted at some involvement in the incidents without expressly----                 acknowledging them.--------                 "Sooner or later, debts have to be repaid," Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser,----                 wrote on Telegram on Wednesday. "Karma is a cruel thing."--------                 Keir Giles, a Russian security expert at the Chatham House think tank in London, said Russia----                 often suffers from accidents and disasters related to negligence and other factors, so the----                 involvement of Ukraine was unclear so long as it didn't take responsibility for the incidents.--------                 "The system suffers from self-inflicted injuries in peacetime," said Mr. Giles. "When put under----                 additional strain of an offensive war, it is no surprise that the rate of natural accidents should----                 increase."--------                 Russia, meanwhile, said it halted gas flows to Poland and Bulgaria beginning Wednesday,----                 marking a significant escalation in the economic conflict between Moscow and the West.----                 Moscow has been trying to strengthen its faltering currency by insisting customers pay in----                 rubles, raising the prospect that Russia could shut off gas flows to other European countries in----                 response to the sweeping economic sanctions imposed by the West for its invasion of Ukraine.----------------                 Russia's finance minister, Anton Siluanov, said Wednesday that Russia's oil production this----                 year could decline by as much as 17% due to the sanctions.--------                 Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, decried the announcement from----                 Russian gas company Gazprom as blackmail and said European Union states are working to----                 secure alternative sources of energy and coordinate storage plans across the bloc.--------                 "This is unjustified and unacceptable," she said. "And it shows once again the unreliability of----                 Russia as a gas supplier."--------                 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday again warned of dire consequences for any----                 country that intends to "interfere in the ongoing events from the outside and create strategic----                 threats for Russia that are unacceptable to us," in remarks to the Russian Federal Assembly's----                 Council of Legislators in Russia's second city of St. Petersburg.--------                 "They should know that our response to counter strikes will be lightning fast," Mr. Putin said.--------                 Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had told Russian media on Monday that the West was----                 now engaged in a proxy war with Russia by arming and assisting Ukraine, and that it could----                 escalate into a global conflict with nuclear weapons.--------                 U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking to reporters at Ramstein Air Base in Germany----                 on Tuesday, said "any bluster about the possible use of nuclear weapons is dangerous and----                 unhelpful."--------------------                 A funeral for a member of Ukraine's territorial defense forces in Bucha, outside Kyiv, on----                 Wednesday.

The agency said the suspects were supporters of Ukrainian nationalists and had sent----                 data about Russian servicemen participating in Moscow's military operation in Ukraine to the----                 Kyiv-based Peacemaker, a website that publishes the personal information of people who----                 allegedly commit crimes against Ukraine and the country's national security.--------                 The Wall Street Journal couldn't independently verify the agency's report of an attempted----                 sabotage.--------                 Russia's Defense Ministry said Wednesday that its forces had launched high-precision,----                 long-range sea-based Kalibr missiles at the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, where----                 they destroyed hangars at an aluminum plant containing a "large batch of foreign weapons and----                 ammunition supplied by the U.S. and European countries for Ukrainian troops." Russian----                 defense officials said their air force hit 59 military facilities in Ukraine overnight, while Russian----                 air-defense systems shot down 18 Ukrainian drones and a Ukrainian tactical Tochka-U missile.----                 Russia's claims couldn't be independently verified.------------------------                 A worker inspected a damaged building in Irpin, Ukraine, on Wednesday.

"Russia has very limited air access to the north and west of Ukraine, limiting offensive----                 actions to deep strikes with stand-off weapons," it said.--------                 The General Staff of Ukraine's armed forces, meanwhile, said Russia had made some----                 advances in the east, where it is pressing a new offensive after its initial attempt to take the----                 capital, Kyiv, and remove President Volodymyr Zelensky failed. Russian forces seized one----                 village and took the outskirts of another as they tried to surround Ukrainian units in the east,----                 where Ukraine has been fighting against Russian proxy forces since 2014.--------                 Russian forces are also attempting to widen a land bridge from Russian-controlled areas of----                 eastern Ukraine's Donbas region to the Crimean Peninsula in the south, which Moscow----                 annexed eight years ago.--------                 Concerns are growing that neighboring Moldova, another former Soviet republic, could be----                 dragged into the conflict. The breakaway pro-Russian enclave of Transnistria on Wednesday----                 reported gunfire and drones spotted over a village near its border with Ukraine after it said----                 three separate attacks earlier this week targeted a Transnistrian military base, two radio towers----                 and the headquarters of its state security service. The village, Cobasna, hosts what it says is----                 Europe's largest ammunition depot. No casualties were reported in any of the incidents, but----                 they have stirred concerns that the 1,500 Russian troops stationed in Transnistria could be----                 deployed in western Ukraine.--------                 Moldova has been on edge since the Russian invasion of Ukraine put it on the border of an----                 active war zone, potentially inflaming Moldova's relationship with Transnistria. The narrow strip----                 of land was carved out of Moldova after a civil war in 1992 and is held by pro-Russian----                 nationalists. Many in the population of 350,000 hold Russian passports.--------                 Diplomatic efforts to end the Ukraine conflict appear to be moving slowly. United Nations----                 Secretary-General António Guterres met with Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Putin in Moscow on Tuesday.----                 After the meeting, Mr. Lavrov blamed the war on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's----                 expansion and accused the West of attempting to create an alternative global governance----                 outside the U.N.--------                 Mr. Guterres is scheduled to meet with Mr. Zelensky in Kyiv on Thursday.--------                 Matthew Luxmoore contributed to this article.--------                 Write to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.com and Ann M.

Plus between----        cross-border attacks and more threatening rhetoric, is the war in Ukraine entering a new phase?--------        Matthew Luxmoore: It definitely seems like there is a pattern forming here, which suggests that the----        10-week conflict now in Ukraine may be spilling out over the borders.--------        Luke Vargas: And President Biden plans his first visit to Asia to assure allies that Europe isn't his only----        focus. It's Thursday, April 28th. I'm Luke Vargas with The Wall Street Journal. Here's the A.M. Edition of----        What's News. The top headlines of business stories moving your world today.--------        UN Secretary-General António Guterres is visiting Kyiv today after a stop in Moscow earlier in the week----        where he called for humanitarian corridors from war-torn areas in Ukraine and a swift end to the conflict.----        The UN estimates that more than 13 million people are trapped in areas affected by war in Ukraine,----        many without access to food, water, or electricity. Meanwhile, the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has----        warned that if Russian President Vladimir Putin wins in his war in Ukraine, there would be "terrible----        consequences across the globe." And she called on Western allies to double down on their support for----        Ukraine.--------        Liz Truss: The world should have done more to deter the invasion and we will never make that same----        mistake again. Some argue that we shouldn't provide heavy weapons for fear of provoking something----        worse. But my view is that inaction would be the greatest provocation. This is a time for courage, not for----        caution.--------        Luke Vargas: We'll have more on whether the war in Ukraine is starting to spill beyond the country's----        borders later in the show. The White House has announced that President Joe Biden will make his first----        visit to Asia as president next month with planned stops in South Korea and Japan. WSJ Tokyo bureau----        chief Peter Landers has more on the goals of the visit, which includes a meeting with South Korean----        president-elect Yoon Suk-yeol just 10 days after his inauguration.--------        Peter Landers: President Biden wants to show that he can walk and chew gum at the same time. Yes,----        there's a war in Ukraine, but out here in Asia, we still have China threatening to take control of Taiwan by----        force and North Korea just had a big military parade showing off its latest intercontinental ballistic----        missiles. And leader Kim Jong-un said he would step up nuclear weapons development. So Biden is----        saying to Asian allies, we haven't forgotten you.--------       Luke Vargas: London-based lender Barclays place has reported a drop in its first-quarter net profits----       driven by lower levels of deal-making and a financial hit caused by a costly clerical error involving the----       sale of certain debt products. Last month, Barclays said it was facing a 450 million pound loss and a----       regulatory investigation in its US division after it accidentally sold more structured notes than it was--------        allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank said it expects to buy the notes back at----        a loss. Barclays's earnings echo the performance of major US banks, including Morgan Stanley and City----        Group, which also reported sizable drops in profitability in the first quarter.--------        And Tesla chief executive Elon Musk won a major victory in a Delaware court Wednesday after a judge----        ruled that Musk didn't act unlawfully in Tesla's roughly $2.1 billion takeover of SolarCity. A group of Tesla----        shareholders had alleged Musk controlled the 2016 acquisition while having a financial interest in both----        companies. They also said that many of Tesla's directors were conflicted and that it overpaid for the----        home solar company. Musk has said he didn't dictate the deal process or price and recused himself from----        the shareholder vote. An attorney for the shareholders said the plaintiffs were considering their options----        and an attorney for Musk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.--------        Natural gas prices on both sides of the Atlantic swung higher on Wednesday in the wake of Russia----        cutting off gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria. European gas prices are still below their peak reached----        last month, but remain roughly five times as expensive as a year ago. And in the US the benchmark----        price also climbed at a time of the year when typically spring's milder weather sets in and drives prices----        lower. WSJ markets reporter, Caitlin Ostroff is here with more on whether we should expect continued----        price increases in Europe and the US and if so for how long. Hey, Caitlin.--------        Caitlin Ostroff: Hey, Luke.--------        Luke Vargas: I think it's obvious why Europe is seeing higher natural gas prices now that a major source----        of its supply is being threatened, but why are prices also up in the US?--------        Caitlin Ostroff: Yeah, so more US natural gas for obvious reasons has been loaded onto tankers and----        sent to European nations. And so because of that trade that's been happening, the market is thinking----        you're more likely to see that, especially as some European supply gets called into question as to----        whether Russia is just going to shut off taps. And even without that, as countries try and wean----        themselves off of dependency on Russia for gas. And so you're going to see some more US gas----        supplementing that. And so that's probably going to keep energy in heating costs a bit higher, both for----        Europe and the US, going into probably even the end of this year, beginning of next year.--------        Luke Vargas: And Caitlin, how long is this spike in prices likely to continue for on both sides of the----        Atlantic?--------        Caitlin Ostroff: Yeah. So in the near term, as you said, we're likely to see these prices remain elevated----        just because of the fact that even though it's spring and getting into summer, and you would see some of----        those prices naturally start to come down, there is all of this uncertainty over what happens with Russian----        energy supplies in the near term. Russia has said that they will cut off other countries outside of Poland if----        they don't pay in rubles, which some countries have said that they wouldn't do previously, but it's also if----        you're under threat of all of your gas being cut off, what if it remains to be seen what countries wind up----        actually doing.--------        And also most countries, even outside of that have said that they plan on winging themselves off of----        Russia by the end of the year for energy supplies. And so getting into next winter, the market is----        expecting that you're still going to have the same demand for energy as you did this past winter, but----        you're still going to see less supplies. And so that's probably going to feed through the higher energy----        prices, at least going in through next winter.--------        Luke Vargas: That was WSJ markets reporter Caitlin Ostroff. Caitlin, thank you.--------        Caitlin Ostroff: Thanks, Luke.--------        Luke Vargas: Coming up from energy cutoffs to attacks beyond Ukraine's borders. Is the war in Ukraine----        escalating into a broader conflict? We'll have that story after the break.--------        An increasing number of recent headlines about the war in Ukraine don't even concern events taking----        place there, whether it's a series of attacks beyond Ukraine's borders in Russia and Moldova, Russian----        warnings about a World War, or Moscow cutting off gas supplies to parts of Europe. WSJ reporter----        Matthew Luxmoore covers Russia for us. And he joins us now to try and put these events into context----        and see if we can connect some dots here. Hi, Matthew. Welcome.--------        Matthew Luxmoore: Sure. Thanks for having me.--------        Luke Vargas: So Matthew, could all of these disparate events actually be connected in some way? And if----        so, might they indicate we are entering maybe a new phase of this Ukraine war?--------------------        Matthew Luxmoore: Yes. It's pretty hard to say at this stage. It seems like every day when you wake up----        now you get some kind of report of a new blast in Russia or in the Moldovan breakaway state of----        Transnistria, so outside Ukraine's borders, which obviously would suggest that the conflict is spilling----        over. Ukraine hasn't claimed responsibility for the attacks on Russia, the attacks on Russian weapons----        depots, and a military research center. And Russia is kind of careful not to blame Ukraine directly for all----        of these attacks and has dismissed some of them at least, or explained some of them as fires, or some----        kind of spontaneous events beyond their control. But it definitely seems like there is a trend, a pattern----        forming here, which suggests that the 10-week conflict now in Ukraine may be spilling out over the----        borders and targeting Russia as well.--------        Luke Vargas: Matthew, could these attacks on Russian territory, even if they're not claimed by Ukraine----        imply a shift in its aims in this war?--------        Matthew Luxmoore: So it's not so much speculation now, it definitely does seem like the rhetoric has----        shifted and Ukraine has become more brazen, I guess, in using some of its Western-made missiles or----        indeed indigenous missiles to target Russian facilities. And it seems like the consensus is that this is----        more permissible for Ukraine to essentially do anything it can to prevent Russia from being able to stage----        these attacks or shore up its military campaign, which is now focused mainly on the east of Ukraine, so----        much closer to Russian territory.--------        Luke Vargas: Meanwhile, Matthew, Russia has accused NATO of fighting a proxy war in Ukraine. What----        is the risk that Moscow expands its operations too if attacks on Russian territory continue?--------        Matthew Luxmoore: In terms of its fight in Ukraine, it seems there's little it can do other than step up the----        intensity of its operation in Ukraine. It's already failed to capture Kyiv, which is part of the reason it's----        shifted to a single direction campaign in the east of the country, as opposed to a multi-pronged assault,----        which didn't work out the first time. But of course, we know that Russia has far more destructive----        weaponry, has long-range ballistic missiles, it has nuclear weapons. There has been speculation recently----        of a possible tactical nuclear strike. I wouldn't want to speculate on the possibility of Russia hitting----        Western weapons facilities far beyond the borders of Ukraine, but Russian officials, some lawmakers----        have already suggested that this might be a adequate response to Western attempts to Ukraine. So it----        does seem like we could be seeing some kind of real escalation beyond the borders of Ukraine if this----        rhetoric, if this standoff continues, especially as long as Russia's conventional campaign in Ukraine is not----        bearing fruit.--------        Luke Vargas: And finally Matthew, in our final moments, what do we need to be watching for next, if it's----        even possible at all to forecast the next turns this war could take?--------        Matthew Luxmoore: Yeah, I'm mean the war has taken so many twists and turns. I would definitely not----        want to be making any predictions, but it does seem like Russia's initial war aims have not worked out as----        it had planned. I think we are probably expecting a big intense thrust in the east of the country. Ukraine is----        obviously putting up a very strong resistance and is receiving more Western weaponry, which helps it----        wage this counter-campaign to Russia's invasion. The only other thing I'd mention is obviously, we----        should be watching out for increased rhetoric from Russia about the possibility of defending itself from----        these attacks, staged on its territory, maybe through the use of more heavy weaponry, including nuclear----        weapons, which obviously would be very concerning if those kinds of statements started coming out of----        Moscow.--------        Luke Vargas: That was WSJ reporter Matthew Luxmoore, who covers Russia for us. Matthew, thank you----        so much for the update.--------        Matthew Luxmoore: Sure, no problem. Thank you very much.--------        Luke Vargas: And finally, for more than a century, the message of America's pastime baseball to----        baseball-loving girls was essentially, you can be a fan, but don't expect to see women on the field or in----        the dugout. But that's quickly beginning to change. In 2018, there were no women in baseball coaching----        positions, now 11 women have on-field coaching jobs across the majors and minors this season. WSJ----        sports reporter, Jared Diamond says this change is thanks in part to MLB's Take The Field Program,----        which provides networking opportunities for women interested in working in baseball, as well as a shift in----        mentality across the sport.--------        Jared Diamond: This idea that you had to have played professional baseball to be a good coach of----        baseball, it's quickly becoming antiquated. We're in this era where so much about baseball is determined----        by data analytics. You clearly don't need to have played to be good at teaching the game. So why----        wouldn't that extend now to women? It's as if they finally realize that there's half the population out there----        that has never been considered for these jobs, that perhaps should be.----------------        Luke Vargas: And that's What's News for Thursday morning.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres is in Ukraine today to meet with President----        Volodymyr Zelenskyy days after meeting with Russian officials on a visit to Moscow. Guterres is calling----        for humanitarian corridors to be set up in war-torn areas of Ukraine, as well as a swift end to the war.----        Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow would have a lightning fast response----        to any country that interferes in the conflict, and in Washington, the White House said President Biden is----        scheduled to speak about the war today.--------        On Capitol Hill, Democrats are working on a last-ditch effort to put together a narrower version of----        President Biden's once-sweeping economic agenda.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----           Natural-gas prices swung higher on both sides of the Atlantic on Wednesday after Russia stopped----           exports to Poland and Bulgaria, a move that investors fear could portend deeper global supply strains----           ahead.--------           Prices climbed as traders in Europe pondered whether Russia's action against two of its neighbors in----           Eastern Europe foreshadows trouble in bigger markets such as Germany's.--------TD----           In the U.S., trading was driven by the prospect that producers could continue to ship abroad as much----           natural gas as infrastructure allows in response to tighter supply abroad.--------           European benchmark prices rose Wednesday by 4.1% to settle at 107.43 euros, or about $114.28,----           per megawatt-hour, in turbulent trading. That is well below the peak price European gas reached in----           March, but still roughly five times as expensive as a year ago.--------           Oil markets were calm, with Brent crude, the international benchmark, gaining 0.3% to settle at----           $105.32. The U.S.'s domestic benchmark rose 0.3% to $102.02. Lockdowns in China meant to----           contain Covid-19 outbreaks have slashed investors' views of world-wide demand, Robert Yawger,----           executive director for energy futures at Mizuho Securities USA, wrote in a note.--------           Russia's Gazprom said Wednesday it cut off exports to Poland and Bulgaria after the two countries----           refused to pay for shipments in rubles. Gas buyers have traditionally paid in dollars or euros, but----           Russian President Vladimir Putinlast month demanded that countries it deemed hostile settle----           contracts in Russian currency.--------           On its own, Russia's move will likely have a limited impact on European supplies -- especially in----           Poland, which already was planning to end reliance on Russian exports by the end of this year.--------           But bigger European economies, such as Germany's and Italy's, could experience shortages if----           Russia turns off supplies, and the growing possibility of that scenario sent prices higher, analysts----           said. Most European countries have rejected Russia's demand for ruble payments.--------           Russia's decision "is increasing the likelihood of a sharp curtailment of Russian gas supply into----           Europe," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy-markets advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates.----           "That's why we're seeing the strong gains."--------           In the U.S., the benchmark price climbed 6.1% Wednesday to settle at $7.27 per million British----           thermal units, building on a significant surge that has lifted natural-gas prices from under $4 at the----           start of the year. Typically, prices decline as spring's milder weather sets in.--------           As European prices rise, more U.S. natural gas has been loaded onto tankers and sent to European----           ports -- a trade that more Russian curtailments could further encourage. That could keep heating and----           energy costs high even into next winter's peak-demand period.--------           American exports overseas already had been rising before Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Last----           year marked the first when American tanker exports of liquefied natural gas exceeded pipeline----           exports to Canada and Mexico, Jefferies researchers said.--------           "We're probably going to be running at or near capacity levels of exported LNG through the rest of----           this year," Mr. Ritterbusch said.--------           U.S. prices for gas to be delivered in December were up almost as much as near-term contracts on----           Wednesday, rising about 4.7% to $7.59.--------           License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------IN         i16 : Electricity/Gas Utilities | i1 : Energy | iutil : Utilities--------NS         mnatgs : Natural Gas Markets | m14 : Commodity Markets | m143 : Energy Markets | mcat :----           Commodity/Financial Market News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfce : C&E----           Exclusion Filter----RE         russ : Russia | eurz : Europe | bul : Bulgaria | pol : Poland | ukrn : Ukraine | usa : United States | asiaz----           : Asia | balkz : Balkan States | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries |----           dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eecz : European Union Countries | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe |----           namz : North America | ussrz : CIS Countries----IPC        GMA--------PUB        Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN         Document J000000020220428ei4s0001b------------------------CLM       REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)----HD        Russia's Energy Extortion--------WC        694 words----PD        28 April 2022----SN        The Wall Street Journal----SC        J----PG        A16----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          An attack on one NATO ally is an attack on all, and that's how Europe and the U.S. should treat----          Russia's decision this week to stop supplying natural gas to Poland and Bulgaria. With enough allied----          coordination, this could boomerang on Vladimir Putin.--------          The Kremlin is extorting Europe by demanding that "unfriendly" countries pay for gas in rubles rather----          than euros or dollars as required under their Gazprom contracts. European companies have been----          ordered to set up two accounts at Gazprombank to enable the currency conversion. Countries that----          refuse, as Bulgaria and Poland have, risk a gas cutoff.--------TD----          "The request from the Russian side to pay in rubles is a unilateral decision and not according to the----          contracts," says European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. "Companies with such----          contracts should not accede to the Russian demands. This would be a breach of the Russian----          sanctions." Mr. Putin hopes to erode Western sanctions, boost the ruble and divide Europe.--------          This may be a tactical blunder. Europe can't replace the 40% or so of its gas that it imports from----          Russia overnight. But Mr. Putin's extortion should harden Europe's resolve to reduce its dependence----          on Russian fuel. Poland shows it can be done sooner than many think.--------          The Poles saw how Mr. Putin had repeatedly weaponized natural gas against Ukraine and prepared by----          building a large liquefied natural gas import terminal on the Baltic Sea. Next week Poland plans to----          open a pipeline linked to Lithuania's LNG terminal. Another pipeline delivering gas from Norway to----          Poland is expected to be completed this fall.--------          Poland says it had planned to let its Gazprom contract expire later this year anyway. Other countries----          are more vulnerable to Mr. Putin's blackmail but they have some short-term alternatives. Bulgaria----          imports some 90% of its gas from Russia but can get more from Turkey and Greece in a pinch. Italy----          has secured a deal to import more gas from Algeria.--------          Germany has scrambled to reduce its dependence on Russian gas, which now accounts for 35% of----          imports, down from 55% last year. Lucky for Germany, wind power is strong in the spring, and power----          plants can switch to burning coal. Mr. Putin's ploy is a prod to Chancellor Olaf Scholz to cancel the----          retirement of Germany's last remaining nuclear plants this year.--------          Mr. Putin wants to raise the costs to Europe for arming Ukraine and sanctioning Russia. Wholesale----          gas prices in Europe rose 20% Wednesday morning and are more than six times higher than a year----          ago. If Mr. Putin cuts off gas to other European countries, the Continent could fall into recession.--------          But cutting off exports would also wound Russia, as fuel sales fund its war machine and nearly half its----          budget. Mr. Putin has few other places to send his gas, so drilling rigs would soon have to be taken----          down and wells sealed. This could do longer-term damage to Russian gas production.--------          Mr. Putin continues to underestimate European solidarity and resolve. He may think his threats will----          erode sanctions, but the opposite may be happening. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that German----          officials were prepared to support a gradual ban on Russian oil imports to the European Union.----------------          The Biden Administration could support the Europeans by imposing secondary sanctions on----          businesses that help finance Russia's oil trade so Mr. Putin can't easily off-load his crude to China and----          India. It should also be moving heaven and earth to ramp up U.S. oil and gas production and exports----          to Europe.--------          Mr. Biden is doing the opposite. Last week the Administration reaffirmed support for a leasing ban on----          public land and imposed new permitting rules that will make it much harder to build pipelines and LNG----          export terminals. This week it reversed a Trump plan to open up the National Petroleum----          Reserve-Alaska to more drilling. Mr. Putin must be smiling.--------          Russia's war on Ukraine has awakened Europeans from their energy illusions, but Mr. Biden is still----          snoozing. Time to wake up, sir.--------          License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------CO        gzpmbk : Gazprombank OAO | gngpf : Gazfond Non-Governmental Pension Fund--------IN        i1 : Energy | i814 : Banking | i81402 : Commercial Banking | ibnk : Banking/Credit | ifinal : Financial----          Services----NS        gvexe : Executive Branch | gext : Extortion/Blackmail | gfinc : Financial Crime | gcat : Political/General----          News | gvio : Military Action | ncolu : Columns | c12 : Corporate Crime/Legal Action | ccat :----          Corporate/Industrial News | gcns : National/Public Security | gcrim : Crime/Legal Action | gpir :----          Politics/International Relations | gpol : Domestic Politics | grisk : Risk News | gvbod : Government----          Bodies | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter | nfcpin :----          C&E Industry News Filter----RE        russ : Russia | eurz : Europe | bul : Bulgaria | pol : Poland | ukrn : Ukraine | usa : United States | asiaz :----          Asia | balkz : Balkan States | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz :----          Developing Economies | eecz : European Union Countries | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | namz :----          North America | ussrz : CIS Countries----IPC       EXE--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document J000000020220428ei4s0001a------------------------HD       The Ukraine Crisis: India's Neutrality on Conflict Frustrates U.S. Efforts--------BY       By Shan Li and Rajesh Roy in New Delhi and Sabrina Siddiqui in Washington----WC       1,043 words----PD       28 April 2022----SN       The Wall Street Journal----SC       J----PG       A9----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

His meeting with the Indian foreign secretary was----         cordial, stressing the strong ties between Washington and New Delhi.--------         But Indian officials said they later felt blindsided when in public comments Daleep Singh warned of----         "consequences" for countries that helped circumvent sanctions. "Such words are never used in----         diplomacy," one Indian official who was privy to the discussions said. "It came as a surprise."--------TD----         A day later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov struck a very different tone after a meeting with his----         Indian counterpart, offering to sell India whatever it wanted to buy.--------         A succession of U.S. officials who have traveled to New Delhi to persuade India to join Washington in----         its effort to isolate Moscow have struggled to persuade the country to come off the sidelines. India has----         stayed neutral in the conflict, abstaining from United Nations votes to condemn Russia's action and----         declining to join sanctions. India's position is partly born of necessity: Russia is its largest arms----         supplier. But it is also the result of lingering mistrust of Washington and an abiding confidence in----         Moscow's reliability that has been built over decades, Indian officials and analysts said.--------         During the Cold War, India adopted an official policy of nonalignment, but in reality forged an alliance----         with Russia, with the bonds growing closer as the U.S. backed rival countries such as Pakistan and----         imposed a slew of sanctions on New Delhi. Although ties with Washington have warmed over the years----         and Indian officials see a future in which the country is more closely aligned with the West, they say----         there remains a strong undercurrent of anti-American sentiment among Indian policy makers that is----         only reinforced when they are chastised publicly.--------         U.S. officials played down the comments from Mr. Singh, the U.S. deputy national security adviser for----         international economics, saying they weren't directed specifically at India and weren't intended as a----         warning.--------         Still, Indian officials say remarks like those make them leery of turning their backs on Moscow. After a----         clash at the country's disputed border with China killed 20 Indian and four Chinese troops in 2020,----         India's defense minister visited Moscow twice within three months, partly to secure more arms and----         ammunition to bolster border defenses, an official with direct knowledge of the matter said. In----         response, Russia supplied more missiles, tank parts and other weapons.--------         "Many people have the belief that Russian friendship has served India's interests when a crisis has----         erupted," said Syed Akbaruddin, former Indian permanent representative to the United Nations and----         dean of the Kautilya School of Public Policy in Hyderabad.--------         For the West, India is one of the last remaining holdouts among the world's major powers to remain----         neutral in the Ukraine war. The country's purchases of oil and other goods could diminish the impact of----         sanctions designed to cripple the Russian economy. But perhaps more important, the Biden----         administration sees its relationship with India as one that will determine the future of security in Asia.----         "This is the one relationship we have to get right," a State Department official said.----------------         India has spent billions of dollars on weapons from Russia, which has been its top arms supplier for----         decades. Despite efforts to diversify its sourcing, nearly 50% of its imported arms still came from----         Russia from 2016 to 2020.--------         In March, India struck a deal with Russia to purchase crude oil at a discount of at least 20% to global----         benchmark prices. Since the invasion of Ukraine, Indian refineries have purchased about 16 million----         barrels of Russian crude oil, with deliveries starting in May. That is close to the total amount imported----         from Russia in 2021, an Indian official said.--------         In a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month, President Biden said he didn't----         believe it was in India's interest to increase imports of Russian oil and reiterated that the U.S. was----         willing to help India diversify its energy sources.--------         U.S. officials say they have made progress with India in talks, pointing to Mr. Modi's recent comments----         condemning the killing of people in Bucha, Ukraine. Some U.S. officials have, nonetheless, expressed----         frustration over India's reluctance to more forcefully condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin.--------         "I think that, to date, there are certainly areas where we have been disappointed by both China and----         India's decisions in the context of the invasion in terms of their reaction overall," said Brian Deese, the----         director of the White House National Economic Council. "Our message to the Indian government is that----         the costs and consequences for them of moving into a more explicit strategic alignment with Russia will----         be significant and long-term."--------         U.S. officials said the intent of dispatching Mr. Singh, an architect of the administration's sanctions----         against Russia, to New Delhi was part of an effort to help allies understand the scope of the penalties----         imposed by the U.S. and European partners. "We don't want anyone to be caught off guard," one----         administration official said. "We want to talk about compliance with them."--------         Biden administration officials have been trying to convince their Indian counterparts that the U.S. will be----         a more reliable arms supplier in its cross-border confrontation with China. U.S. officials have argued----         that the Ukraine war shows that Russian military equipment is unreliable and that it will soon be in short----         supply.--------         This month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged the complicated history between the U.S.----         and India and Russia, when he and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met their Indian counterparts.--------         "India's relationship with Russia developed over decades, at a time when the United States was not----         able to be a partner to India," Mr. Blinken said. "Times have changed. Today we are able and willing to----         be a partner of choice with India."--------         License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------NS       gvdhs : Department of Homeland/National Security | gdip : International Relations | gvio : Military Action----         | gcat : Political/General News | gcns : National/Public Security | gpir : Politics/International Relations |----         gpol : Domestic Politics | grisk : Risk News | gvbod : Government Bodies | gvexe : Executive Branch----RE       india : India | russ : Russia | ndelh : New Delhi | ukrn : Ukraine | usa : United States | delhi : Delhi |----         asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing----         Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe | indsubz : Indian Subcontinent | namz :----         North America | sasiaz : Southern Asia | ussrz : CIS Countries----IPC      EXE--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document J000000020220428ei4s00017------------------------HD       The Ukraine Crisis: Russian Arms Depot Catches Fire --- Ukraine doesn't take credit, but official----         calls recent similar events 'karma' for waging war----BY       By James Marson and Ann M.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         An ammunition depot caught fire near Russia's border with Ukraine, a local official said, the latest in a----         series of incidents to afflict Russian military facilities in regions adjacent to Ukraine in recent weeks that----         could pressure supply lines to Russian forces.--------         The fire at the depot in a village near Belgorod, around 15 miles from the border, was extinguished by----         early morning Wednesday, according to Vyacheslav Gladkov, the regional governor.--------TD----         Authorities also reported blasts in Russia's Kursk and Voronezh regions, which are adjacent to Ukraine.----         The regions' governors said air-defense systems shot down drones in the early hours of Wednesday.--------         The incidents follow a series of similar events in recent weeks in the regions neighboring eastern----         Ukraine, where Russia is attempting to seize territory. Russian officials said two Ukrainian helicopters----         struck an oil-storage facility on the outskirts of Belgorod on April 1. Fires broke out at two fuel-storage----         depots in the Bryansk region on Monday.--------         Russia said the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, the missile cruiser Moskva, sank in a storm after an----         ammunition explosion on board on April 14, while the U.S. said it was struck by Ukrainian missiles.--------         Ukrainian officials have hinted at some involvement in the incidents without expressly acknowledging----         them.--------         "Sooner or later, debts have to be repaid," Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, wrote----         on Telegram on Wednesday. "Karma is a cruel thing."--------         Keir Giles, a Russian security expert at the Chatham House think tank in London, said Russia often----         suffers from accidents and disasters related to negligence and other factors, so the involvement of----         Ukraine was unclear so long as it didn't take responsibility for the incidents.--------         "The system suffers from self-inflicted injuries in peacetime," said Mr. Giles. "When put under additional----         strain of an offensive war, it is no surprise that the rate of natural accidents should increase."--------         Russia, meanwhile, said it halted gas flows to Poland and Bulgaria beginning Wednesday, marking a----         significant escalation in the economic conflict between Moscow and the West. Moscow has been trying----         to strengthen its faltering currency by insisting customers pay in rubles, raising the prospect that Russia----         could shut off gas flows to other European countries in response to the sweeping economic sanctions----         imposed by the West for its invasion of Ukraine. Russia's finance minister, Anton Siluanov, said----         Wednesday that Russia's oil production this year could decline by as much as 17% due to the----         sanctions.--------         Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday again warned of dire consequences for any country----         that intends to "interfere in the ongoing events from the outside and create strategic threats for Russia----         that are unacceptable to us," in remarks to the Russian Federal Assembly's Council of Legislators in----         Russia's second city of St. Petersburg.--------         "They should know that our response to counter strikes will be lightning fast," Mr. Putin said.------------         Russia's Federal Security Service, meanwhile, said Wednesday that two Russian citizens were----         detained as they were allegedly preparing to sabotage a transport-infrastructure site in Belgorod. The----         agency said the suspects were supporters of Ukrainian nationalists and had sent data about Russian----         servicemen participating in Moscow's military operation in Ukraine to the Kyiv-based Peacemaker, a----         website that publishes the personal information of people who allegedly commit crimes against Ukraine----         and the country's national security.--------         The Wall Street Journal couldn't independently verify the agency's report of an attempted sabotage.--------         Russia's Defense Ministry said Wednesday that its forces had launched high-precision, long-range----         sea-based Kalibr missiles at the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, where they destroyed----         hangars at an aluminum plant containing a "large batch of foreign weapons and ammunition supplied----         by the U.S. and European countries for Ukrainian troops." Russian defense officials said their air force----         hit 59 military facilities in Ukraine overnight, while Russian air-defense systems shot down 18 Ukrainian----         drones and a Ukrainian tactical Tochka-U missile. Russia's claims couldn't be independently verified.--------         The General Staff of Ukraine's armed forces, meanwhile, said Russia had made some advances in the----         east, where it is pressing a new offensive after its initial attempt to take the capital, Kyiv, and remove----         President Volodymyr Zelensky failed. Russian forces seized one village and took the outskirts of----         another as they tried to surround Ukrainian units in the east, where Ukraine has been fighting against----         Russian proxy forces since 2014.--------         License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------NS       gdip : International Relations | gvio : Military Action | gcat : Political/General News | gcns :----         National/Public Security | gpir : Politics/International Relations | grisk : Risk News----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | ussrz : CIS Countries | rucfd : Central Federal District | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | bric----         : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----         Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe----IPC      IGV--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document J000000020220428ei4s00013------------------------HD         The Ukraine Crisis: Renault Set To Unload 68% Stake in Russian Firm--------BY         By Nick Kostov----WC         224 words----PD         28 April 2022----SN         The Wall Street Journal----SC         J----PG         A8----LA         English----CY         Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         WASHINGTON -- At least six hacking groups linked to the Russian government have attempted----         hundreds of cyberattacks in Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February, including dozens intended to----         destroy computer systems, according to new research from Microsoft Corp.--------         Moscow's hacking activity amounts to a relentless onslaught of disruptive and destructive operations,----         often tactically paired with kinetic military maneuvers, in addition to traditional cyber espionage,----         Microsoft said. Though many attacks have been successful, Ukraine's cyber defenses have repelled----         others, and Ukraine has so far largely evaded the kind of debilitating or nationwide cyber disruption that----         Western officials feared at the onset of the war.--------TD----         "The attacks have not only degraded the systems of institutions in Ukraine but have also sought to----         disrupt people's access to reliable information and critical life services, and have attempted to shake----         confidence in the country's leadership," Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice president of customer security and----         trust, said in a blog post accompanying the research.--------         In a briefing with reporters on Wednesday, Victor Zhora, the deputy chief of Ukraine's cyber defense----         agency, said he thought Russia had activated its full offensive cyber capabilities against Ukraine as the----         war has dragged on and was unlikely to deploy "completely new" or unexpected cyber weapons.--------         "They are a serious threat. It would be a mistake to underestimate their potential " Mr. Zhora said. "But----         at the same time. . .I suppose that we are completely able to resist, in cyberwar and the war generally."--------         The Russia-backed hackers had also been "pre-positioning for conflict" as early as March 2021, Mr.----         Burt said, apparently in hopes of gaining broader access to Ukrainian networks that could be leveraged----         during the war. By mid-2021, some of the hackers were targeting supply-chain vendors in Ukraine and----         elsewhere "to secure further access not only to systems in Ukraine but also NATO member states," Mr.----         Burt said, referring to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Supply-chain vendors are companies that----         sell software or other products that are widely used by other companies, making them lucrative targets----         for hackers.--------         The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request to comment. Moscow has routinely----         denied allegations of cyberattacks against other countries and said it has been victimized recently by----         cyberattacks launched by Western powers.--------         The new findings from Microsoft, published Wednesday, largely support what cybersecurity experts,----         large technology companies and Western intelligence officials have observed so far: While large-scale,----         knockout blows have eluded them or been thwarted, Russian hackers have been highly active in the----         Ukraine conflict, focusing much of their efforts on more limited, tactical operations to support their----         military engagements.--------         Some attacks have been crude and amounted to mere annoyances, slowing some Ukrainians' internet----         service or knocking it out altogether, defacing websites and destroying files on a small number of----         computers. Others have accomplished little more than keeping Ukraine's cyber-defenders busy. More----         recently, as Russia's strategic aims shifted to eastern Ukraine, new and more alarming attacks on----         Ukraine's energy sector have been discovered.------------         Hackers have been pummeling the Ukrainian government and critical infrastructure since the beginning----         of the war, but over the past three weeks researchers at Cisco Systems Inc. have seen a gradual----         increase in sophisticated attacks from what appear to be more-experienced hackers, said Matt Olney,----         Cisco's director of threat intelligence. "Before it was truly bull-in-a-china-shop type of stuff," he said.----         "Now it's more [like] sophisticated art theft."--------         In contrast to the confidence expressed by Mr. Zhora of the Kyiv government, U.S. and Western----         intelligence officials have said they believe Russia has the capabilities and resources to deliver----         far-more-damaging cyberattacks against Ukraine.--------         Microsoft said it had observed nearly 40 destructive cyberattacks in Ukraine on hundreds of systems.----         Of those, more than 40% targeted critical infrastructure sectors that could have knock-on effects on the----         Ukrainian government, military, economy and populace, Microsoft said.--------         -----------         Robert McMillan contributed to this article.--------         License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------CO       mcrost : Microsoft Corporation--------IN       i3302 : Computers/Consumer Electronics | i330202 : Software | i3302021 : Applications Software |----         icomp : Computing | itech : Technology----NS       ghack : Cybercrime/Hacking | gcrim : Crime/Legal Action | gdip : International Relations | gvio : Military----         Action | gcat : Political/General News | gcns : National/Public Security | gpir : Politics/International----         Relations | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E Executive----         News Filter----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----         Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe | ussrz :----         CIS Countries----IPC      MEN--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document J000000020220428ei4s0000v------------------------CLM      Commodities----SE       Markets----HD       Russian Gas Stoppages Spur Europe's Race for New Energy Supplies; European officials say----         Kremlin is throttling gas for Poland and Bulgaria to warn countries not to impose embargoes or----         arm Ukraine----BY       By Georgi Kantchev, Joe Wallace and Matthew Dalton----WC       1,715 words----PD       27 April 2022----ET       22:16----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

EU officials accused----         Moscow of using energy as a political weapon. The speaker of Russia's State Duma, Vyacheslav----         Volodin, said on Wednesday that Moscow should expand the measures against other nations that it----         deems unfriendly.--------         Two months into Russia's war on Ukraine, EU countries are accelerating their efforts to replace----         Russian oil and gas. Steps by Germany and other national governments to switch suppliers are now----         proceeding rapidly, threatening to diminish Russia's hitherto most lucrative source of foreign earnings.--------         Germany and the EU have faced much criticism in recent weeks, including from Ukrainian President----         Volodymyr Zelensky, for their continued purchases of Russian oil and gas, which help fund Russia's----         budget and its war effort.--------         The EU is debating potential sanctions on Russian oil, including a full but phased-in embargo, but----         national measures by European countries are creating new facts on the ground faster than the----         negotiations in Brussels.--------         Germany, Europe's biggest economy, said on Tuesday it has all but overcome its need to import oil----         from Russia, thanks in part to an agreement with Poland over the use of ports and pipelines. Berlin said----         that phasing out Russian gas would take longer but that it is working on it.--------         For Moscow, the decision to throttle gas flows to Poland and Bulgaria is a high-risk gamble that could----         undermine one of main supports of Russia's embattled economy. Oil and gas sales provide around----         40% of the Russian government's revenues. The EU is Russia's main gas market.--------         "Gazprom's announcement is another attempt by Russia to blackmail us with gas," European----         Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday. She said that Bulgaria and Poland----         are already receiving gas from EU neighbors and that discussions are ongoing on how to prevent----         significant disruptions.--------         Analysts at energy consulting firm Rystad said that "Russia has fired the first shot back at the West,"----         wielding energy as a weapon.------------          "Russia is trying to shatter the unity of our allies," Mr. Zelensky's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on----          Telegram.--------          The Kremlin on Wednesday denied it was using energy as a weapon and said it remains a reliable----          energy supplier.--------          Many European countries have been scrambling to line up alternative gas supplies for next winter's----          heating season, mainly liquefied natural gas imported from the U.S. and the Middle East, and gas piped----          in from Norway and North Africa. The EU aims to head into next winter with its gas storage facilities----          80% full and to slash its purchases of Russian gas by two-thirds by the end of this year.--------          The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is likely to make proposals next week for a sixth----          round of economic sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including an embargo on oil or----          other measures to cut Moscow's revenues from oil sales. Several member states including Germany----          and Hungary have so far resisted a full embargo. But European demand for Russian oil is plummeting----          anyway.--------          Russia's state oil company has had trouble finding buyers for oil in recent days. European refineries are----          already shifting away from Russian crude oil, even without sanctions.--------          France's TotalEnergies SE has stopped buying Russian crude for its four oil refineries in France and----          Belgium. The company is still buying Russian crude under a supply contract for its refinery in Leuna,----          Germany, but a company official said the refinery would soon replace that with non-Russian oil brought----          in from the Polish port city of Gdansk.--------          Total is still buying some diesel from Russia under previous contracts but says it will end those----          purchases by the end of the year as the contracts expire.--------          Exxon Mobil Corp., which owns six refineries in continental Europe, said it has decided not to sign new----          contracts for Russian crude oil since the Feb. 24 invasion. The company was previously a big buyer of----          Russian crude.--------          European officials said they expect Moscow to cut gas supplies to more countries. Before the war in----          Ukraine, the EU sourced some 40% of its gas from Russia.--------          Latvian Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš said in an interview that Russia's moves are likely meant as----          warnings to the EU to slow down or stop its preparations for a full embargo on Russian oil.--------          "The question is who is more resilient?" Mr. Kariņš said, urging his EU colleagues not to be deterred.----          "The Ukrainians are paying with their lives, we are paying with higher energy prices."--------          Further gas stoppages by Russia would likely send fuel prices higher, analysts said, putting more----          pressure on the EU's slowing economy and feeding into higher energy bills world-wide by prompting a----          race to find gas on international markets. In the U.S., natural-gas prices have doubled this year, in part----          because producers of LNG are shipping it to Europe at breakneck speed.--------          Natural-gas prices in Europe are currently below their peak in March but well above their levels a year----          ago and remain a key source of inflationary pressure in European economies. Benchmark prices----          jumped 11% on Wednesday.--------          SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS--------          What do you think of Russia's move to cut off gas? Weigh in below.--------          Mr. Putin demanded last month that countries deemed hostile to Moscow, including EU members, pay----          for gas in rubles. Gas contracts are usually denominated in dollars or euros. A subsequent Kremlin----          decree tweaked the order: Customers had to pay in euros or dollars to Russia's Gazprombank, which----          would convert the money into rubles and send them on to Gazprom itself. The EU has said its----          sanctions don't prevent companies from doing that.--------          Some European officials said Russia's move against Poland and Bulgaria was likely not about payment----          modalities but was a warning aimed at all EU members that are sending weapons to Ukraine.--------          Germany on Tuesday announced that it would deliver antiaircraft cannon tanks to Ukraine, ditching its----          previous reluctance to send heavy weapons and joining a growing number of countries, led by the U.S.,----          that are arming Ukraine's defenders with artillery, armored vehicles and other powerful weaponry.--------         Russia's gas stoppage will have limited effect on Poland, which was already set to become----         independent of Russian gas by the end of this year. Still, Poland was due to receive at least a further 5--------         billion cubic meters in gas from Gazprom which likely won't be delivered and will need to be replaced----         this summer, said James Huckstepp, European gas analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights. Most of----         the gas will be pumped across the border from Germany, he added.--------         The stoppage is a bigger problem for Bulgaria, which gets more than three quarters of its gas from----         Russia and has few quick or easy options to replace it. A new pipeline from Greece to Bulgaria to----         deliver gas from Azerbaijan has faced long delays and has yet to be completed, said Tom----         Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at ICIS. Using complex swap arrangements, Bulgaria could----         replace some of its Russian gas through an existing pipe to Greece, he said.--------         Bulgaria's energy minister Alexander Nikolov said on Wednesday that the country has enough gas in----         storage for the coming month and is looking for alternative deliveries.--------         "Because all trade and legal obligations are being observed, it is clear that at the moment the natural----         gas is being used more as a political and economic weapon in the current war," Mr. Nikolov said.--------         Bulgaria's ruling coalition has been split on the issue of sending weapons to Ukraine. A delegation led----         by Bulgaria's prime minister, Kiril Petkov, is headed to Kyiv this week.--------         In Berlin, the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz is accelerating investments in renewable energy----         and building LNG terminals. In the event of a full shutdown of Russian gas inflows, Germany would----         need to ration energy and suspend some industrial activity, according to analysts. The country's leading----         economic think tanks said in a report earlier in April that Germany would enter a sharp recession if----         Russian energy deliveries are completely cut off.--------         Russia's move against Poland and Bulgaria is being watched closely in Italy, the second-largest buyer----         of Russian gas after Germany. Italy has already started to wean itself off Russian gas: the country's----         imports so far in April are about half the level of the same month last year.--------         Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and his foreign minister have crisscrossed Africa in the past month----         in search of deals to increase gas supplies from countries including Algeria, Mozambique and Angola.--------         Moscow has long used gas as a way to achieve its geopolitical aims. Last fall, Russia withheld----         deliveries to Europe from the short-term gas spot market despite a global shortage. It also kept the----         level of storage sites it controlled across the continent at low levels, helping to push prices to record----         highs. European lawmakers called for a probe into Russia's manipulation of the market. Mr. Putin at the----         time dismissed criticism of the Kremlin's energy tactics as "politically motivated blather."--------         —Laurence Norman, Eric Sylvers and Anna Hirtenstein contributed to this article.--------         Write to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com and Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com--------         Russian Gas Stoppages Spur Europe's Race for New Energy Supplies--------CO       gzprm : Gazprom PJSC | euruno : European Union--------IN       i1 : Energy | i13 : Crude Oil/Natural Gas Upstream Operations | ifosfl : Fossil Fuels | iioil : Integrated----         Oil/Gas----NS       gvexe : Executive Branch | gtrade : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | c13 : Regulation/Government Policy |----         ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | e51 : Trade/External Payments | ecat : Economic News | gesanc :----         International Sanctions | gpir : Politics/International Relations | m14 : Commodity Markets | ncolu :----         Columns | gcat : Political/General News | gdip : International Relations | gpol : Domestic Politics | gvbod----         : Government Bodies | mcat : Commodity/Financial Market News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva----         Filters | nfce : C&E Exclusion Filter | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter----RE       russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | bul : Bulgaria | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eecz : European Union Countries |----         eurz : Europe | pol : Poland | uk : United Kingdom | ukrn : Ukraine | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia----         Pacific | balkz : Balkan States | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz----         : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      GAZP.RS--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220427ei4r001e1--------------------CLM       Markets Main----SE        Markets----HD        Indonesia, World's Largest Palm-Oil Producer, Bans Exports of Ubiquitous Commodity; Policy----          follows sharp rise in cooking-oil prices at home, caused in large part by disruptions stemming----          from Russia's war in Ukraine----BY        By Jon Emont----WC        651 words----PD        27 April 2022----ET        23:47----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          SINGAPORE—Palm oil is one of the world's most ubiquitous food commodities, found in candy bars,----          ice cream, pizza dough and cooking oil. It is about to get harder to source.--------          Starting Thursday, Indonesia—which accounts for 60% of global supply—will stop palm-oil exports, a----          sweeping decision that will make cooking meals more expensive for families around the world and----          cause headaches for a range of food and cosmetics manufacturers. The ban follows a sharp rise in----          cooking-oil prices at home, caused in large part by disruptions stemming from Russia's invasion of----          Ukraine.--------TD----          "As the world's largest producer of palm oil, it's ironic that we're facing difficulties acquiring cooking----          oil," said President Joko Widodo in a speech late Wednesday. "As the president I'm not going to let----          that happen," he said, adding that he would restore exports once domestic needs are met.--------          Shortages in the supply of sunflower oil from Ukraine have driven up prices of all other edible oils,----          including palm oil, which is a key ingredient in cooking oil. As a result, cooking-oil prices in Indonesia----          have risen 45% since February, according to government data. Prices were also pushed up by----          drought in South America, which produces soybeans, another key source of vegetable oil.--------          Indonesia's policy is the latest example of protectionist measures as countries act to secure their own----          food supply amid rising prices. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a mid-April speech urged----          governments to avoid export restrictions that could further drive up prices. U.S. inflation rose to a new----          four-decade high of 8.5% in March from the same month a year ago.--------          Since the start of the war in late February, governments have placed 36 new curbs on food and----          fertilizer exports, not counting restrictions connected to sanctions imposed by various countries----          against Russia and Belarus, according to Global Trade Alert, an independent trade-monitoring----          organization. That is double the number of restrictions introduced before the war this year, its data----          showed.--------          Russia has restricted wheat exports, and smaller suppliers like Serbia and North Macedonia have also----          curbed trade, according to David Malpass, president of the World Bank Group. In mid-April,----          Kazakhstan established quotas on wheat and wheat-flour exports. Egypt in March imposed a----          three-month export ban on wheat, corn and cooking oil in part to secure supplies for Ramadan.--------          Indonesia has cycled through various policies in recent months, mandating cooking-oil producers to----          sell a hefty share of their product domestically and imposing price controls at different times. On----          Tuesday, the government said it would ban exports of palm olein, a refined form of palm oil used to----          make cooking oil. In a broad policy expansion the next day, it said many other forms of palm oil would----          also be banned from export.--------------------          "Here you have a big food commodity with the biggest supplier in the world market putting its feet on----          the brake," said Josef Schmidhuber, deputy director of the United Nations Food and Agriculture----          Organization's trade and markets division.--------          Some palm-oil analysts estimate that the ban will likely last only for a few weeks, as Indonesia has----          limited storage capacity and its exports are a key source of foreign exchange. Still, its impact will be----          widely felt. Palm oil is a rare major food commodity for which the bulk of global supply is concentrated----          in a single country. Major importers of Indonesian palm oil include China, India, and the U.S.--------          Write to Jon Emont at jonathan.emont@wsj.com--------          Indonesia, World's Largest Palm-Oil Producer, Bans Exports of Ubiquitous Commodity--------IN        i411 : Vegetable Oils | i010013202 : Edible Oil Plant/Seed Farming | i41 : Food/Beverages | icnp :----          Consumer Goods | ifood : Food Products | i0 : Agriculture | i01001 : Farming | i0100132 :----          Oilseed/Grain Farming----NS        gtrade : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | gesanc : International Sanctions | e51 : Trade/External Payments----          | ecat : Economic News | gpir : Politics/International Relations | m14 : Commodity Markets | mcat :----          Commodity/Financial Market News | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News | gfod :----          Food/Drink | gdip : International Relations | glife : Living/Lifestyle | ncat : Content Types | nfact :----          Factiva Filters | nfce : C&E Exclusion Filter----RE        indon : Indonesia | russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe |----          seasiaz : Southeast Asia | uk : United Kingdom | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric :----          BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----          Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD       Wires--------IPC       I/FBT--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220427ei4r0058x------------------------CLM       European Business News----SE        Business----HD        France's Total Takes $4.1 Billion Charge Related to Russia Sanctions; The energy giant said----          Western sanctions would affect an Arctic natural-gas project that had been expected to launch----          next year----BY        By Jenny Strasburg----WC        471 words----PD        28 April 2022----ET        02:28----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BP has warned that its Russia exit could result in potential losses, including write-downs and----          charges, totaling up to $25 billion.--------          The companies haven't spelled out how they will divorce themselves from Russia holdings, following----          decades of business collaboration in the country.--------          Rather than an exit, Total has pledged to curtail its Russian energy purchases—ending its buying of----          Russian oil and petroleum products by the end of this year—while complying with sanctions.--------          "Abandoning these interests without consideration would enrich Russian investors, in contradiction----          with the sanctions' purpose," the company said in March.--------          Total's multibillion-dollar write-down, announced a day before its scheduled first-quarter earnings----          report, reflects a decision that it can no longer count on anticipated reserves from Arctic LNG 2. Total----          said sanctions have starved the project of technology and goods crucial to production.--------          The company reiterated last month that it would provide no new capital for projects in Russia. It also----          said it plans gradually to suspend its Russia activities while keeping its workforce safe, but didn't say it----          will withdraw from minority stakes in a number of Russian energy operators.--------          Total holds a roughly 20% stake in Russian producer OAO Novatek, a privately held gas company run----          by a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The partners' Arctic LNG 2 project, once----          valued at about $21 billion, had been expected to launch in 2023 and eventually reach full capacity of----          almost 20 million tons.--------          Total has previously said it would continue taking gas from another Russian project that began----          shipping in 2017, as long as European governments consider Russian gas necessary.--------          Write to Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com------------          France's Total Takes $4.1 Billion Charge Related to Russia Sanctions--------CO        bp : BP PLC | fdp : TotalEnergies SE | gzprm : Gazprom PJSC--------IN        ifosfl : Fossil Fuels | i1 : Energy | i13 : Crude Oil/Natural Gas Upstream Operations | i1300004 :----          Liquefied/Compressed Gas | i5020022 : Oil Production Platform Construction | iindstrls : Industrial----          Goods | i14 : Downstream Operations | i502 : Heavy Construction | iconst : Construction | icre : Real----          Estate/Construction | iioil : Integrated Oil/Gas----NS        c24 : Capacity/Facilities | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | e51 : Trade/External Payments | ecat :----          Economic News | gesanc : International Sanctions | gpir : Politics/International Relations | gtrade :----          Trade Barriers/Restrictions | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News | gdip : International----          Relations | ncat : Content Types----RE        russ : Russia | arct : Arctic | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eecz : European Union Countries |----          eurz : Europe | fra : France | namz : North America | uk : United Kingdom | ukrn : Ukraine | usa :----          United States | ussrz : CIS Countries | weurz : Western Europe | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS----          Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----          Central/Eastern Europe | medz : Mediterranean----IPD       Wires--------IPC       BP--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220427ei4r006sh------------------------CLM       Risk & Compliance Journal----SE        C Suite----HD        Sanctions Turn Into New Priority for Justice Department; Department's white-collar----          enforcement efforts increasingly have a national-security focus after Russia's invasion of----          Ukraine, says Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco----BY        By Dylan Tokar----WC        424 words----PD        28 April 2022----ET        03:35----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Prosecutors----          have used the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits payments by companies to foreign----          officials, to target large corporations and impose billions of dollars in fines.--------          The Justice Department's white-collar enforcement efforts increasingly have a national-security focus,----          Ms. Monaco said Wednesday. "One way to think about this is as sanctions being the new FCPA," she----          said to a room of white-collar defense lawyers.--------          Financial institutions often are the first entities to be held responsible for sanctions violations,----          particularly in situations where they process payments by individuals or companies that violate----          national security prohibitions. But companies also need to be aware of the rules, including by applying----          know-your-customer processes to their supply chains, Ms. Monaco said.--------          The Biden administration last year said it was making rooting out corruption a central pillar of its----          national-security agenda, issuing a directive it said would increase collaboration between government----          agencies on issues such as kleptocracy and illicit finance.--------          In the wake of the invasion of Ukraine in February, the Justice Department launched an interagency----          task force dedicated to enforcing sanctions and export-control measures implemented against Russia----          in response to its military action.--------          Andrew Adams, co-chief of the Justice Department's KleptoCapture task force, said the new team----          would draw on existing department resources to prosecute individuals and companies evading----          sanctions and to seize assets linked to corrupt Russian oligarchs.--------          "The task force is investigating entrenched, well-funded organized crime," said Mr. Adams, who spoke----          at a separate session at the same event Wednesday.--------          Write to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com--------          Sanctions Turn Into New Priority for Justice Department--------CO        usdojc : United States Department of Justice--------NS        gvjus : Justice Department | gvbod : Government Bodies | gvio : Military Action | gpir :----          Politics/International Relations | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News | gcns :----          National/Public Security | gpol : Domestic Politics | grisk : Risk News | gvexe : Executive Branch | ncat----          : Content Types----RE        russ : Russia | usa : United States | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe----          | namz : North America | uk : United Kingdom | usmi : Michigan | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia----          Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing----          Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | usc : Midwest U.S. | weurz : Western Europe----IPD       Wires--------IPC       G/JUS--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220427ei4r007k9------------------------CLM     Earnings----SE      Business----HD      Grain Traders' Profits Rise as Ukraine War Tightens Global Food Supply; Higher commodity----        prices for wheat, corn, and strong consumer demand boost ADM, Bunge----BY      By Patrick Thomas----WC      937 words----PD      27 April 2022----ET      21:07----SN      The Wall Street Journal Online----SC      WSJO----LA      English----CY      Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bad weather afflicting other big crop-producing countries,----        including in South America, is also fueling the supply crunch. Meanwhile, demand remains robust for----        food, livestock feed and fuel made from grains, industry executives said.--------TD----        Those factors have helped push global food prices to record levels in recent weeks. For grain-trading----        giants such as Archer Daniels Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill Inc., which help direct the flow of----        corn, soybeans, wheat and other food commodities around the world, the crop-supply crunch and higher----        prices that follow have been a benefit.--------        "These market disruptions are rerouting many traditional trade flows and contributing to crop price----        inflation," Bunge Chief Executive Greg Heckman said on a call with analysts. "Industry margins spiked----        globally due to the combination of continued strong demand and an even tighter supply outlook."--------        St. Louis-based Bunge on Wednesday posted a higher first-quarter adjusted profit and raised its----        full-year earnings forecast. ADM on Tuesday reported a 53% profit increase for the three-month period----        ended March 31, helped by higher trading margins. Both companies' quarterly results outpaced Wall----        Street analysts' expectations.--------        Bunge's agribusiness unit reported an about 7% decline in volumes and a nearly 15% rise in sales, due----        to smaller soybean crops in South America and tightening global supplies of various vegetable oils.--------        Illinois-based ADM said it expects the tight supply of crops to continue for the next few years because of----        the drought conditions in South America, a weak Canadian canola crop and the war in Ukraine.--------        "From a global pandemic to the short crop in South America to the conflict in Ukraine, it has become----        clear that we cannot take an abundant and efficient supply of food for granted," said company CEO----        Juan Luciano on a Tuesday conference call.--------        Russia's war in Ukraine involves two of the world's major grain-producing powers, upending a region----        that has become increasingly critical to feeding a growing and more affluent global population. Global----        food prices hit a record high in March, the United Nations said earlier this month, as the war threatens to----        cause food shortages in some of the world's poorest countries.--------        The dent in exports from the Black Sea region has pushed the price of wheat up about 40% this year. At----        least two crops are likely to be needed to fill the projected crop shortfall created by Russia's invasion of----        Ukraine, according to BMO Capital Markets analysts.--------------------        ADM posted quarterly earnings of $1.05 billion, or $1.86 per share, compared with $689 million, or----        $1.22 per share, a year ago. Bunge reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $4.26 per share for the----        quarter ended in March, compared with $3.13 the same period a year ago. The company said an----        adjusted measure of profits, which strips out some one-time items, rose to $800 million from $671----        million a year ago.--------        Shares of ADM are up more than 30% this year, while Bunge is up more than 20%. Cargill is closely----        held and doesn't report quarterly results.--------        Shifting trade flows, high wheat prices and rising demand for U.S. grains are boosting other agricultural----        companies. Farmer cooperative CHS Inc., which has a large grain-trading business, earlier this year----        posted a quarterly profit of $219 million for the three months ended Feb. 28, compared with a loss of----        $38.2 million a year earlier. Jay Debertin, CEO of CHS, said strong demand and global market volatility----        contributed to CHS's higher earnings.--------        Grain-trading companies including Cargill have said they plan to continue to ship grain from Russia.----        Bunge and ADM said they are seeking alternate routes to move crops out of war-torn Ukraine to get as----        much of the region's crop production as possible exported into world markets.--------        ADM has about 650 employees in Ukraine, while Bunge has about 1,000 workers, two oilseed----        processing facilities, a port, several grain elevators and an office in Kyiv. Bunge restarted certain----        commercial and operational activities in Ukraine in late March, mainly exporting grain via rail and truck,----        though only limited amounts, said Mr. Heckman.--------        Higher commodity prices and rising global food costs aren't likely to derail growing consumer demand----        coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, ADM executives said. Sales for alternative meats and dairy----        products that ADM produces are expected to increase 14% annually, the company said.--------        "Pent-up demand remained solid, even in the face of higher prices," said Mr. Luciano. "There has also----        been salary inflation and wages inflation that has put money in the pockets of customers."--------        Some analysts have cautioned that a recession in the U.S. or Europe caused by higher inflation could----        dampen demand over time.--------        "Rapid inflation across the world could cause demand destruction in certain industries, and since----        agribusinesses serve a wide array of customers and industries, including food, feed, fuel, and industrial----        companies, a recession could significantly impact financial results," said Arun Sundaram, a senior----        equity analyst at CFRA Research.--------        Write to Patrick Thomas at Patrick.Thomas@wsj.com--------        Grain Traders' Profits Rise as Ukraine War Tightens Global Food Supply--------CO      arch : Archer Daniels Midland Company | bngltd : Bunge Limited | crginc : Cargill, Inc.--------IN      i0 : Agriculture | i0100132 : Oilseed/Grain Farming | i41 : Food/Beverages | icnp : Consumer Goods |----        ifood : Food Products | i01001 : Farming | i416 : Flour/Malt Products----NS      mwheat : Wheat Markets | mgroil : Grains/Edible Oils Markets | c15 : Financial Performance | gvio :----        Military Action | c151 : Earnings | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | magric : Soft Commodity Markets |----        mcorn : Corn Markets | mgrain : Grain Markets | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News | gfod :----        Food/Drink | reqraf : Suggested Reading Agriculture/Forestry | gcns : National/Public Security | glife :----        Living/Lifestyle | grisk : Risk News | m14 : Commodity Markets | m141 : Agricultural Commodity Markets----        | mcat : Commodity/Financial Market News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfce : C&E----        Exclusion Filter | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter | redit : Selection of Top Stories/Trends/Analysis |----        reqr : Suggested Reading Industry News----RE      ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | uk : United Kingdom----        | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----        Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD     Wires--------IPC     ADM--------PUB     Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN      Document WSJO000020220427ei4r003h1--------------------CLM      European Business News----SE       Business----HD       Renault in Talks to Sell Russia Business for One Ruble; French car maker discusses handing----         over its 68% stake in Russia's biggest auto maker to a state-backed entity----BY       By Nick Kostov----WC       814 words----PD       28 April 2022----ET       00:24----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         PARIS—French auto maker Renault SA is in talks with the Russian government about handing over its----         68% stake in Russia's biggest auto maker to a state-backed entity, according to a report in Russian----         state media.--------         The French auto maker is expected to sell its stake in AvtoVAZ for the symbolic sum of one ruble to----         NAMI, a state-backed automotive research and development center, Russian Industry Minister Denis----         Manturov was quoted as saying by Russia's state-run news agency Ria Novosti.--------TD----         The French car maker would have the option to buy back its stake within five to six years as part of a----         potential deal, Mr. Manturov said, according to Ria Novosti. Mr. Manturov also said that Renault's----         factory in the center of Moscow, which makes vehicles under the Renault and Nissan brands, will be----         transferred to the city's government, according to Ria Novosti.--------         Mr. Manturov's office didn't respond to a request for comment.--------         Last month, Renault said that it was assessing options on its stake of AvtoVAZ and planned to write off----         the value of its Russian activities, which were valued at €2.2 billion, or around $2.4 billion, at the end of----         last year.--------         Renault and other Western firms have been under pressure to divest from Russia since its full-scale----         invasion of Ukraine began in late February, triggering waves of Western sanctions aimed at cutting off----         Moscow from the global financial system. The sanctions have crippled supply chains, making it hard for----         foreign firms to operate in Russia while also depriving them of any Western buyers for their Russian----         assets.--------         Renault's deep roots in Russia makes it a bellwether for other Western companies exploring options on----         how to leave the country. Renault invested billions of euros in Russia and last year had almost 30% of----         market share there. It also employs some 40,000 people in the country.--------         Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, is considering legislation that would allow Russia----         to nationalize the assets of foreign companies that have exited from the country in response to its----         invasion of Ukraine. The ruling United Russia party, which proposed the legislation, said it is aimed at----         preventing bankruptcies and preserving jobs. Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved the----         proposal.--------         Renault's buyback options will be priced according to how much money is invested in AvtoVAZ while it----         is under NAMI's stewardship, Mr. Manturov said, according to Ria Novosti, adding: "There will be no----         gifts here."--------         At the start of the war, Renault initially tried to keep its activities in Russia going while also exploring----         ways to leave the country, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm tried to reorganize its----------------         supply chain to replace parts its factories were missing because of sanctions and the war in Ukraine,----         these people said.--------         As the war continued, however, Renault's operations in Russia began to burn through their cash----         reserves. The auto maker had to continue paying salaries and suppliers as sales and production----         shriveled.--------         Since then, the AvtoVAZ plant has been running at much reduced capacity as Western sanctions and----         the global chip shortage deprived it of key parts. Renault's plant in Moscow, meanwhile, reopened for a----         few days last month to liquidate the stock of parts that it had on hand, but it has since been closed for----         weeks.--------         Stellantis NV—maker of the Jeep and Peugeot brands—last week suspended its operations in Russia,----         citing a "rapid increase in cross sanctions and logistical difficulties."--------         NAMI is a Moscow-based automotive development and research center founded in 1918 after the----         Bolshevik Revolution. The group co-owns Aurus, a Russian car company launched in 2018 that aims to----         produce luxury vehicles. Mr. Putin that year drove through Moscow in an Aurus car on his inauguration----         day for a fourth term.--------         Russian state-owned conglomerate Rostec Corp. owns the remaining 32% of AvtoVAZ. Its CEO,----         Sergei Chemezov, has been subject to Western sanctions for years over Russia's annexation of----         Crimea.--------         AvtoVAZ produces Lada, Russia's only homegrown brand with significant market share, accounting for----         21% of auto sales in Russia last year. The company was founded in 1966 when the Soviet Union built----         a mammoth factory on the banks of the Volga River and renamed the city that mushroomed around it----         after Palmiro Togliatti, the leader of Italy's Communist Party at the time. The plant sprawled over 1,000----         acres, more than New York's Central Park.--------         Evan Gershkovich contributed to this article.--------         Write to Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com--------         Renault in Talks to Sell Russia Business for One Ruble--------CO       rnltl : Renault SA | vlgmov : AvtoVAZ JSC | nisan : Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. | renanb : Renault-Nissan----         B.V.----IN       iaut : Automotive | i35101 : Passenger Cars | i351 : Motor Vehicles--------NS       ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | cdiv : Divestments | c181 : Acquisitions/Mergers/Shareholdings | c23----         : Research/Development | cacqu : Acquisitions/Mergers | cactio : Corporate Actions | gcar : Cars | gpir :----         Politics/International Relations | gpol : Domestic Politics | gvio : Military Action | ncolu : Columns | gcat :----         Political/General News | c18 : Ownership Changes | gcns : National/Public Security | glife :----         Living/Lifestyle | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E Industry----         News Filter----RE       russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | uk : United Kingdom | ukrn : Ukraine----         | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----         Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      7201.TO--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220427ei4r005mt------------------------CLM      Europe News----SE       World----HD       EU Targets Hungary's Funding Amid Russia Sanctions Fight; Brussels activates, for the first----         time, a tool that could lead to the EU blocking large amounts of budget payouts to Hungary----BY       By Laurence Norman----WC       734 words----PD       27 April 2022----ET       19:58----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         The European Union's executive body laid down a sharp new challenge to Hungarian Prime Minister----         Viktor Orban on Wednesday, activating a tool for the first time that could see Brussels withhold----         large-scale EU budget payments to the country.--------TD----         The move threatens to escalate years of tensions between Mr. Orban—whose conservative----         government recently won a landslide election victory at home—and Brussels and some western----         European governments. It comes as the EU faces major decisions on how to raise economic pressure----         on Russiaover its invasion of Ukraine including energy sanctions which Hungary has so far opposed.--------         The new EU mechanism was created in 2020 alongside approval of the 750-billion-euro coronavirus----         recovery fund, equivalent to $790.97 billion, when Hungary and Poland, who both have conservative,----         nationalist governments, were clashing with Brussels and some EU governments over judicial----         overhauls, rule-of-law standards and social issues.--------         The conditionality mechanism, as it is formally known, allows the EU to block countries from receiving----         budget money if Brussels can show that their lack of independent courts or their weak anticorruption----         agencies present a risk that the EU's money—meant for the building of roads, trains, bridges and other----         social programs—could be misspent.--------         The decision is the latest twist in a yearslong struggle between the EU and Hungary, which has tried to----         create a new model of European democracy, in which ruling parties are able to cement power over----         institutions such as courts and state media.--------         The Commission decided not to trigger the mechanism against Poland but will keep monitoring the----         situation.--------         Any decision to block funds will likely take months and will depend on the backing of a super majority----         of member states—meaning support from at least 55% of EU countries representing at least 65% of----         the EU population.--------         At a press conference on Wednesday, Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for values and----         transparency, said the Commission had sufficient evidence of breaches of financial management rules----         that Brussels was confident it would win any Hungarian court challenge against a block on funds.--------         Ms. Jourova said the EU concerns focused on how the government awards EU-funded government----         contracts and the lack of an anticorruption strategy in Hungary, which receives several billion euros a----         year from Brussels.--------         "We are sure that in the case of Hungary, we have sufficient evidence that there are such breaches of----         the rules," Ms. Jourova said.--------------------         In what he said was a response to the EU decision, Zoltan Kovacs, Mr. Orban's international----         spokesman, said on Twitter: "HUN voters have spoken clearly on April 3. We must keep HU out of the----         war, make sure that HUN families don't pay the price of war."--------         Along with Poland, Mr. Orban fought strongly against the rule-of-law instrument, at first threatening to----         block approval of the recovery and then launching an EU court challenge against its legality. The----         European Court of Justicerejected that case in February.--------         Mr. Orban and his top officials have long attacked what they say is a power grab by Brussels and EU----         courts against elected national governments. They have called the instrument a blackmail tool to force----         them to follow issues such as immigration and social values.--------         The EU has already put on hold more than €7 billion in coronavirus fund recovery money for Hungary,----         representing around 5% of the country's gross domestic product. However, until now, the EU hasn't----         ever tried to pre-emptively block regular annual budget funds from being paid out.--------         The decision—following months of pressure on the European Commission to act from EU lawmakers----         and some EU governments—comes as divisions have opened up over further sanctions measures----         against Russia over Ukraine.--------         Hungary has been among the most vocal opponents of a push by more member states to block EU----         purchases of Russian energy, a position that has hardened, according to diplomats, since Mr. Orban's----         election win in early April. The vote saw his Fidesz party win a supermajority in parliament, giving Mr.----         Orban a fourth successive term in power.--------         Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com--------         EU Targets Hungary's Funding Amid Russia Sanctions Fight--------CO       euruno : European Union--------NS       gcat : Political/General News | e211 : Government Budget/Taxation | c341 : Government Aid/Grants |----         gvexe : Executive Branch | c13 : Regulation/Government Policy | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News |----         ecat : Economic News | gdip : International Relations | gesanc : International Sanctions | gpir :----         Politics/International Relations | ncolu : Columns | e21 : Government Finance | gpol : Domestic Politics----         | gvbod : Government Bodies | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E Industry----         News Filter----RE       hung : Hungary | eecz : European Union Countries | asiaz : Asia | belg : Belgium | easiaz : Eastern----         Asia | eurz : Europe | russ : Russia | uk : United Kingdom | ukrn : Ukraine | ussrz : CIS Countries |----         weurz : Western Europe | apacz : Asia Pacific | benluxz : Benelux Countries | bric : BRICS Countries |----         devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern----         Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      N/CMR--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220427ei4r00335------------------------CLM              World News----SE               World----HD               Hackers Linked to Russia Launched Hundreds of Cyberattacks in Ukraine, Microsoft----                 Says; Flurry of malicious activity often coincides with Russian military operations,----                 researchers say----BY               By Dustin Volz----WC               922 words----PD               27 April 2022----ET               22:30----SN               The Wall Street Journal Online----SC               WSJO----LA               English----CY               Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Though many attacks have been successful, Ukraine's cyber----                 defenses have repelled others, and Ukraine has so far largely evaded the kind of debilitating or----                 nationwide cyber disruption that Western officials fearedat the onset of the war.--------                 "The attacks have not only degraded the systems of institutions in Ukraine but have also----                 sought to disrupt people's access to reliable information and critical life services, and have----                 attempted to shake confidence in the country's leadership," Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice----                 president of customer security and trust, said in a blog post accompanying the research.--------                 In a briefing with reporters Wednesday, Victor Zhora, the deputy chief of Ukraine's cyber----                 defense agency, said he thought Russia had activated its full offensive cyber capabilities----                 against Ukraine as the war has dragged on and was unlikely to deploy "completely new" or----                 unexpected cyber weapons.--------                 "They are a serious threat. It would be a mistake to underestimate their potential " Mr. Zhora----                 said. "But at the same time… I suppose that we are completely able to resist, in cyberwar and----                 the war generally."--------                 The Russia-backed hackers had also been "pre-positioning for conflict" as early as March----                 2021, Mr. Burt said, apparently in hopes of gaining broader access to Ukrainian networks that----                 could be leveraged during the war. By mid-2021, some of the hackers were targeting----                 supply-chain vendors in Ukraine and elsewhere "to secure further access not only to systems--------                 in Ukraine but also NATO member states," Mr. Burt said, referring to the North Atlantic Treaty----                 Organization. Supply-chain vendors are companies that sell software or other products that are----                 widely used by other companies, making them lucrative targets for hackers.--------                 The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.----                 Moscow has routinely denied allegations of cyberattacks against other countries and said it----                 has been victimized recently by cyberattacks launched by Western powers.--------                 The new findings from Microsoft, published Wednesday, largely support what cybersecurity----                 experts, large technology companies and Western intelligence officials have observed so far:----                 While large-scale, knockout blows have eluded them or been thwarted, Russian hackers have----                 been highly active in the Ukraine conflict, focusing much of their efforts on more limited, tactical----                 operations to support their military engagements.--------                 Some attacks have been crude and amounted to mere annoyances, slowing some Ukrainians'----                 internet service or knocking it out altogether, defacing websites and destroying files on a small----                 number of computers. Others have accomplished little more than keeping Ukraine's----                 cyber-defenders busy. More recently, as Russia's strategic aims shifted to eastern Ukraine,----                 new and more alarming attacks on Ukraine's energy sector have been discovered.--------                 Hackers have been pummeling the Ukrainian government and critical infrastructure since the----                 beginning of the war, but over the past three weeks researchers at Cisco Systems Inc. have----                 seen a gradual increase in sophisticated attacks from what appear to be more-experienced----                 hackers, said Matt Olney, Cisco's director of threat intelligence. "Before it was truly----                 bull-in-a-china-shop type of stuff," he said. "Now it's more [like] sophisticated art theft."--------                 In some cases, Russia's cyberattacks appeared "strongly correlated and sometimes directly----                 timed with its kinetic military operations," Mr. Burt said. He cited an example of cyberattacks----                 directed at a major broadcasting company, Ukrtelecom, on March 1, the same day that----                 Russian forces launched a missile strike on a TV tower in Kyiv. In another example, a separate----                 Russian hacking group stole data in mid-March from a nuclear safety organization in the weeks----                 following Russia's capture of nuclear power plants, Microsoft said.--------                 The efforts to hybridize the war have also been seen in the disinformation space. As Mariupol----                 endured a prolonged siege by Russian forces, some Ukrainians were sent an email from a----                 Russian hacking group pretending to be a resident of the city who accused the Ukrainian----                 government of abandoning its citizens, Microsoft said.--------                 In contrast to the confidence expressed by Mr. Zhora of the Ukrainian government, U.S. and----                 Western intelligence officials have said they believe Russia has the capabilities and resources----                 to deliver far more damaging cyberattacks against Ukraine than what has been seen so far.----                 Some have said Russia's initial miscalculation that Kyiv would fall in a matter of days----                 contributed to an early reticence to launch cyberattacks against critical infrastructure that could----                 severely cripple daily life in Ukraine.--------                 Microsoft said it had observed nearly 40 destructive cyberattacks in Ukraine on hundreds of----                 systems. Of those, about a third were directly aimed at Ukrainian government entities at the----                 national, regional and city levels, and more than 40% targeted critical infrastructure sectors----                 that could have knock-on effects on the Ukrainian government, military, economy and----                 populace, Microsoft said.--------                 Robert McMillan contributed to this article.--------                 Hackers Linked to Russia Launched Hundreds of Cyberattacks in Ukraine, Microsoft Says--------CO               mcrost : Microsoft Corporation--------IN               i3302 : Computers/Consumer Electronics | i330202 : Software | icph : Computer Hardware | iint----                 : Online Service Providers | itech : Technology | icomp : Computing | i3302021 : Applications----                 Software----NS               ghack : Cybercrime/Hacking | ncolu : Columns | nimage : Images | gcat : Political/General----                 News | gcrim : Crime/Legal Action | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E----                 Executive News Filter----RE               ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | namz : North America |----                 russ : Russia | uk : United Kingdom | usa : United States | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia----                 Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing----                 Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe--------IPD              Wires--------IPC              CSCO--------PUB              Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN               Document WSJO000020220427ei4r004ph------------------------CLM       Russia News----SE        World----HD        Russia's New Economic Data Is Inconsistent on Impact of War and Sanctions; Figures----          published by Moscow don't track private-sector surveys that show a sharp contraction in----          Russian manufacturing----BY        By Paul Hannon, Georgi Kantchev and Yuliya Chernova----WC        1,531 words----PD        28 April 2022----ET        02:16----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          The West has leveled waves of sanctions against the Russian economy. The crucial question is, are----          they working?--------          Russia on Wednesday released inconsistent data that showed the economy in March was either doing----          fine or just treading water. Private-sector data has shown a sharp slowdown in Russia.--------TD----          Economists had expected the first official Russian numbers on the economic impact of the invasion of----          Ukraine and the sanctions to show declines in economic growth and industrial output and a pickup in----          unemployment.--------          Russia's Ministry of Economic Development said on Wednesday that the country's economic output----          was 1.6% higher in March than a year earlier. That is a sharp deceleration from the 4.3% expansion----          recorded in February, and the 5.8% growth in gross domestic product seen in January, according to----          TASS, the state-owned news agency.--------          The country's official statistics agency, known as Rostat, published more positive data, saying that----          factory output was just 1% lower in March than in February when seasonal variations in activity are----          accounted for. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1%, Rostat said.--------          It may be too soon for the impact of the war and sanctions to be reflected in the economic data. The----          numbers may also be less reliable than in the past, as Russia looks to clamp down on the view the----          outside world has on its economy.--------          Liam Peach, an economist with Capital Economics, said some of the data appeared to diverge from----          nonofficial measures of economic output. "Such a mild contraction in industrial production seems----          inconsistent with the expected hit from the imposition of Western sanctions last month," he said. He----          noted that private sector manufacturing surveys showed a sharp decline for March.--------          A measure of private-sector activity in March based on a survey of 500 businesses by S&P Global----          recorded the sharpest fall since May 2020, when Russia was in the early stages of the Covid-19----          pandemic.--------          Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24, prompting governments to impose a punishing series of----          sanctionsintended to weaken Russia's capacity to wage war. The sanctions imposed in the early----          weeks of the invasion aimed to sever many of Russia's links to the global financial system and limit its----          access to international logistics and transport networks.--------          On Wednesday, Russia halted natural-gas deliveries to European Union members Poland and----          Bulgaria in retaliation against those sanctions. The stakes are high for the Russian economy since oil----          and gas sales make up more than 40% of the federal budget and Europe is Russia's main gas market.----------------          Russia's oil production this year may decline by as much as 17% in volume terms because of Western----          sanctions, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Wednesday.--------          Russian policy makers, including President Vladimir Putin, have acknowledged that the sanctions have----          caused economic harm, but haven't publicly quantified the scale of the damage with hard data.----          International economists have a range of estimates, with the International Monetary Fund expecting to----          see a decline in gross domestic product of 8.5% this year.--------          "This will be the deepest economic crisis since the early '90s," said Vasily Astrov, a Russia-focused----          economist at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies.--------          While day-to-day life in Russia has largely continued, there are clear signs the economy has been----          shaken. Job recruiters have seen hiring plummet as foreign businesses lay off workers. Businesses----          have struggled to export goods and source parts for operations, while consumers grapple with inflation.--------          The downturn is Russia's latest in a series of dark times since the end of communism. Russia suffered----          a collapse in economic output following the breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, a----          government-debt meltdown in 1998, and a contraction and currency depreciation in 2015 in response----          to sanctions following Russia's annexation of Crimea.--------          Russian factories have struggled to find parts that they had previously imported from Western----          suppliers, while seeing their access to foreign buyers cut off by financial and logistics roadblocks.--------          Production of cardboard, the packaging of choice for online commerce, has collapsed by 25% since----          the end of February because of sanctions and a fall in domestic consumption as Western brands----          suspended their work in the country, according to Russia's League of Waste Paper Processors.--------          "Everyone is busy looking for new markets in order to export maximum products," said Aleksey----          Sergeev, chief executive of the organization.--------          Around 650,000 tons of cardboard are sitting idle in warehouses across Russia. That is the equivalent----          of a month-and-a-half of stock, compared with a usual stock level covering seven to 10 days, Mr.----          Sergeev said.--------          SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS--------          Do you think sanctions will be effective in putting pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the war?--------          The data published Wednesday represent a curtailed view into the economy. Russian authorities----          stopped publishing some key figures, including data on government debt, trade flows and oil----          production. Analysts say the partial blackout is part of an effort to deprive Western governments of the----          information they would need to effectively target new sanctions.--------          The statistics agency had a record of accurately reflecting the ups and downs of the economy in the----          years before the war.--------          The statistics agency had previously recorded a sharp pickup in inflation during March, reflecting the----          ruble's steep decline in the early weeks of the war and a rush to stockpile essentials by households in----          anticipation of shortages. The ruble, supported by restrictions on taking money out of the country, has----          since rebounded to its prewar levels. The rise in consumer prices has also slowed.--------          But the long-term effects of the war are still unfurling and the impact on Russia's job market may not----          be felt for months. Some employers, including foreign companies, have put workers on furloughs and----          reduced working hours, obscuring them from job-loss figures.--------          Marina Zaretskaya, a recruiter for the Russian franchise of ManpowerGroup, said the number of open----          positions that she is working to fill has dropped about 70% since the invasion. Ms. Zaretskaya, based----          in St. Petersburg, helps with placements in the northwest region of Russia, including cities like----          Murmansk.--------          She said there are roughly 10 open positions per recruiter at her agency, down from about 30 two----          months ago. Many of her clients were foreign companies with operations in Russia, she says. Some----          are winding down operations, while others are trying to sort out their future.--------          "There's a freeze," she said. Companies aren't growing because they are uncertain about investing----          when new sanctions and logistics problems could appear at any time, Ms. Zaretskaya said.--------         Smaller firms are suffering from a loss of access to export markets. Before the war, Victoria----         Razdoburdina had a thriving business selling dried-flower décor through the online marketplace Etsy.--------          Deliveries from Russia were so reliable and quick that many of her American clients mistook her St.----          Petersburg location for the city in Florida, she said.--------          FedEx suspended shipments in Russia on March 4. Ms. Razdoburdina switched to DHL and sent her----          last order on March 5. The same day, PayPal, which was Ms. Razdobudrina's only way of receiving----          payments, suspended its service. And then Etsy locked access to her shop, called----          ForgetMeNotNature, and all other sellers in Russia and Belarus.--------          Ms. Razdoburdina let go of her two employees and gave up the lease for her studio.--------          "It wasn't just a job, it was a job we loved," said Ms. Razdoburdina, who moved to Tbilisi, Georgia, to----          try to restart her livelihood.--------          Another wild card for Russia's economy is energy exports. With prices for oil and natural gas having----          risen since the invasion, the IMF estimates that energy exports will be worth $350 billion to the Russian----          economy this year, up 40% from 2021.--------          That estimate, and its forecast for an 8.5% contraction in broader economic output this year, depend----          on the assumption that no additional sanctions are imposed on Russian energy exports.--------          In an alternative scenario where broad sanctions on energy exports are announced by the middle of----          this year, the IMF said overseas sales of oil and gas would fall by 10% this year and 20% next,----          remaining at that low level in following years. The hit to the economy would be very large, with output----          likely to be 15% lower by 2027 than would be the case under the existing sanctions.--------          EU nations have resisted imposing direct sanctions on Russian energy, fearing the backlash on their----          own economies in the form of higher prices. But member states are expected to discuss an embargo----          proposal next week as part of a sixth round of sanctions.--------          Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com, Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com and----          Yuliya Chernova at yuliya.chernova@wsj.com--------          Russia's New Economic Data Is Inconsistent on Impact of War and Sanctions--------CO        rumedt : Russia Ministry of Economic Development | imonf : International Monetary Fund--------NS        ecat : Economic News | c13 : Regulation/Government Policy | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | e11 :----          Economic Performance/Indicators | e51 : Trade/External Payments | gesanc : International Sanctions |----          gpir : Politics/International Relations | gtrade : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | ncolu : Columns | npred :----          Economic Predictions/Forecasts | gcat : Political/General News | gdip : International Relations | ncat :----          Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter----RE        russ : Russia | ussrz : CIS Countries | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | apacz : Asia----          Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing----          Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe----IPD       WSJ--------IPC       N/CNW--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220427ei4r005k1------------------------CLM      World News----SE       World----HD       Chinese Drone Giant DJI Suspends Business in Russia, Ukraine; The Chinese drone maker's----         decision to halt activities, pending a compliance review, follows complaints from Ukrainian----         officials about its products----BY       By Dan Strumpf----WC       445 words----PD       27 April 2022----ET       16:55----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

DJI has said that it never tampered with its products and that it was trying to fix the----         malfunction problems.--------TD----         "DJI is internally reassessing compliance requirements in various jurisdictions. Pending the current----         review, DJI will temporarily suspend all business activities in Russia and Ukraine," the company said in----         a brief statement Tuesday.--------         DJI didn't say which compliance requirements were behind its decision. The U.S. and its allies have----         imposed an array of wide-ranging export controls and sanctions on Russia in the wake of its invasion----         of Ukraine. They include a ban on exports to Russia's defense sector and complex restrictions on the----         export to Russia of foreign products made using U.S. equipment, software or blueprints.--------         Although numerous Western firms have publicly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and----         announced curtailments in business in Russia, Chinese companies have been largely silent on the----         conflict despite controlling large shares of the market for many products.--------         Drones have played an outsize role in the Russia-Ukraine war. Recently, devices from U.S. startups----         have increasingly been used by Ukrainians in search-and-rescue efforts and other aspects of the----         country's defense. That comes after Ukrainian officials raised concerns about Russia's successful use----         of DJI equipment. In March, Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov called on DJI in a public----         letter to halt its business in Russia.--------         Ukrainian officials also complained about the failure of a DJI product known as AeroScopes,----         drone-detection systems used to identify and track other drones and their pilots. Ukraine had used----         AeroScopes around the country, in some cases to protect critical infrastructure. Ukrainian officials and----         DJI said several of these systems wouldn't switch on at the start of the war, prompting some----         Ukrainians to allege that DJI had tampered with the systems to allow Russian drones to fly undetected.--------         DJI has said its products are for civilian use only and the company deplores the use of its products to----         cause harm.--------         Write to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com--------         Chinese Drone Giant DJI Suspends Business in Russia, Ukraine--------CO       sdjtcc : SZ DJI Technology Co.

That was before Russia's invasion----         of Ukraine in late February upended the global metals markets and caused a nickel-trading fiasco at----         the LME.--------TD----         The LME, a unit of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., suspended trading of nickel contracts for----         more than a week in March, after a surge in pricessaddled some market participants—including a----         Chinese nickel giant—with heavy losses.--------         It was the first time the LME froze trading for a metal since the collapse of an international tin cartel in----         1985, and the 145-year-old exchange came under criticism from traders for the way it handled the----         crisis.--------         "Events of recent weeks have brought into focus the importance of the LME and the metals markets,"----         Mr. Chamberlain said Wednesday. He said he wants to support "the long-term health and efficiency of----         the market" as he remains in his post.--------         Nicolas Aguzin, chief executive of HKEX, said he was pleased with Mr. Chamberlain's decision to stay----         with the company after "his handling of the unprecedented developments in the nickel market."--------         On a conference call Wednesday, Mr. Aguzin said Mr. Chamberlain has the full support of LME's----         board. He added that nickel-trading reviews are still being conducted by the exchange, as well as U.K.----         financial regulators.--------         The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority earlier this month said it will examine how LME handled the----         March 8 trading suspension, which lasted for six sessions.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         BERLIN—Mercedes-Benz Group AG, the German luxury car maker, saw net profit fall nearly a fifth in----         the first three months of the year because of higher costs, including expenses related to the suspension----         of business in Russia in the wake of the war in Ukraine.--------         The Stuttgart-based auto maker of Mercedes-Benz branded cars and vans said on Wednesday that----         business throughout the year would be impacted by the continuing shortage of semiconductors, rising----         raw-materials prices, continued disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in China, and new----         volatility in supply chains from the war.--------TD----         "The geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions continue to be characterized by an exceptional degree----         of uncertainty, including the war in Ukraine, its impacts on supply chains, and the development of prices----         for raw materials and energy," Mercedes said.--------         The warning offers a glimpse of the struggles facing European manufacturers as they attempt to----         navigate an unprecedented succession of economic shocks that are complicating planning, raising----         costs, gumming up production and depressing demand.--------         Auto manufacturers in particular have been struggling to cope with higher costs from rising----         raw-materials and energy prices, the semiconductor shortage, the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns on----         their supply chains, and now new bottlenecks caused by the war in Ukraine.--------         Mercedes said in its interim report that net profit attributable to shareholders fell to €3.49 billion in the----         three months ended March 31, compared with €4.29 billion the year before, resulting in a drop in----         earnings per share to €3.26 from €4.01 the year before.--------         One reason for the drop was Mercedes's decision to suspend business with Russia after Moscow's----         attack on Ukraine, a move the company said resulted in expenses of €709 million, equivalent to $754----         million.--------         Mercedes-Benz new car sales fell 10% to 487,008 vehicles in the first quarter "mainly due to----         semiconductor supply bottlenecks, Covid-19 lockdowns, as well as the war in Ukraine," the company----         said in its report.--------         Mercedes was able to offset some of the negative impacts on its earnings through currency hedging,----         one-off asset sales and its ability to boost revenue through higher prices and a continued shift in its----         model offering to more upscale, higher-priced luxury vehicles.--------         Mercedes earnings before interest and taxes, which doesn't include special charges and expenses,----         rose 11% to €5.23 billion in the quarter.--------         Looking ahead to the full year, Mercedes largely stuck to its outlook given after the close of the 2021----         business year, but warned that the months ahead were fraught with volatility and uncertainty.------------         "The general market risks have risen from medium to high compared to the annual report 2021," the----         company said.--------         Write to William Boston at

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----        Vladimir Putin's decision to cut off natural gas shipments to Poland and Bulgaria after those countries----        refused to pay in Rubles was undoubtedly a big deal. The price of European natural gas spiked as much----        as 24% after the news came out. But it has since come back down and was recently trading about 4%----        higher. Putin still has power over European energy, but it has diminished since the start of the war.--------TD----        Europe depended on Russia for more than 40% of its natural gas as of last year, and the EU has been----        reluctant to cut off those shipments despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Natural gas is particularly----        crucial in winter, when it's used to heat homes. In early March, Dutch-traded natural gas futures spiked----        above 200 euros per megawatt-hour. Today, despite Putin's aggressive move toward Poland and----        Bulgaria, they trade at 107 euros. There are four major reasons that it's not causing a bigger spike.--------        First, natural gas demand is down because the weather is warmer and fewer people need it for heat.----        Natural gas accounts for nearly 40% of the energy for heating in Europe. When Europeans start turning----        down their thermostats, their natural gas bills tend to dip too. If Putin had cut off gas to Poland and----        Bulgaria in February, the impact would likely have been larger.--------        Second, Poland and Bulgaria depend heavily on Russia for most of their natural gas, but they're not the----        biggest users of gas in the region. Germany, Italy and Turkey import much more Russian gas by----        volume, and any attempt by Russia to cut off gas to those users would likely cause a bigger impact —----        and hurt Russia's revenues more, too. Goldman Sachs analyst Samantha Dart wrote that "a full----        interruption of Russian flows to Germany would potentially lift European gas prices to over 200 euros----        per megawatt hour this summer."--------        Third, Europe is better-prepared for a slowdown in shipments than it was two months ago. Putin initially----        had the element of surprise. Now Europe has found new sources of natural gas and is expediting efforts----        to transition away from it. A new pipeline is expected to open between Norway and Poland this fall, and----        the region has increased its imports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG.--------        That leads to the fourth reason –- U.S. shipments of gas in liquefied form have helped Europe transition----        away from Russia and allowed some countries to start refilling their storage tanks ahead of next winter.----        The U.S. has announced plans to ship over 60% more LNG to Europe in 2022 than it did in 2021. Given----        capacity expansions at some plants, it looks increasingly likely that the U.S. can achieve that goal.--------        Although it didn't rock the markets as much as initially expected, Putin's decision to cut off gas supplies----        does raise the stakes of the current conflict for Europe. It could cause Germany to focus even harder on----        finding a compromise, Dart predicts. "Today's events can work as an added incentive for the EU, and----        especially Germany, to find a way to work out a Ruble payment mechanism given the significant----        economic toll a halt in gas flows would have in the region," she wrote.--------        Why Russia's Control Over Energy Markets Is Waning--------IN      i1 : Energy--------------------NS      gvexe : Executive Branch | gpir : Politics/International Relations | m14 : Commodity Markets | m15 :----        Derivative Securities | mcat : Commodity/Financial Market News | mequid : Equity Derivatives | gcat :----        Political/General News | gpol : Domestic Politics | gvbod : Government Bodies | ncat : Content Types |----        nfact : Factiva Filters | nfce : C&E Exclusion Filter----RE      russ : Russia | pol : Poland | bul : Bulgaria | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eecz : European Union----        Countries | eurz : Europe | uk : United Kingdom | ukrn : Ukraine | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia----        Pacific | balkz : Balkan States | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz :----        Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD     Commodities--------IPC     M/ENE--------PUB     Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN      Document BON0000020220427ei4r003e9------------------------HD          The Ukraine Crisis: Blasts in Pro-Russia Enclave Roil Moldova--------BY          By Matthew Luxmoore----WC          424 words----PD          27 April 2022----SN          The Wall Street Journal----SC          J----PG          A7----LA          English----CY          Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

No casualties were reported.--------TD----            Moldova has been tense since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which put the country, a small----            impoverished former Soviet state, on the edge of an active war zone. Transnistria, a narrow strip of----            land bordering Ukraine, was carved out of Moldova in the country's 1992 civil war and is held by----            pro-Russian separatists.--------            Moscow has military forces -- which it describes as peacekeepers -- and a base there. A large part of----            the population of 350,000 have Russian citizenship following a campaign by the Kremlin to secure----            passports for them. Only a handful of authorities around the world recognize the independence of----            Transnistria.--------            The government of Moldovan President Maia Sandu on Tuesday said the explosions were a----            provocation aimed at creating unease between the enclave and the rest of Moldova.--------            "Our analysis shows that there's tension between various forces inside Transnistria who are----            interested in destabilizing the situation," Ms. Sandu told reporters after a Moldovan security-council----            meeting.--------            Following the explosions, authorities in Transnistria raised the terrorism threat to the highest level,----            increased the combat readiness of security forces and declared a state of emergency, with military----            checkpoints installed near city limits.--------            "The danger has reached real levels. Explosions can be heard in the country," Vadim Krasnoselsky,----            the president of Transnistria, wrote on Telegram. "Naturally, every challenge will be met with an----            adequate response."--------            Ms. Sandu said the security council had recommended improving the combat readiness of security----            forces, increasing the number of patrols and checks near Moldova's border with Transnistria and----            monitoring critical infrastructure more closely.--------            "We denounce any provocations or efforts to draw the Republic of Moldova into acts that can----            endanger peace in the country," she said.--------            The Kremlin on Tuesday said it is following the situation in Transnistria closely. "Obviously the news----            coming from there is causing concern," said President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov.--------            License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------------------NS          gvio : Military Action | gsec : State Security Measures/Policies | gterr : Terrorism | gcat :----            Political/General News | gcns : National/Public Security | gcrim : Crime/Legal Action | grisk : Risk----            News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter----RE          moldv : Moldova | russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz :----            Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz----            : Europe | ussrz : CIS Countries----IPC         IGV--------PUB         Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN          Document J000000020220427ei4r00019------------------------SE        Daily----HD        Oil Prices Rise and Natural Gas Surges as Russia Cuts Supplies to Eastern Europe--------BY        By Brian Swint----WC        264 words----PD        27 April 2022----ET        18:53----SN        Barron's Online----SC        BON----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Russia accounts for about 40% of the EU's natural gas imports.--------          Nevertheless, Poland said it doesn't yet need to tap into its reserves to cope with the drop in supply,----          and the EU said it had been preparing for months should Russian supplies be cut off.

While earnings had been boosted a year earlier by the release of $435----             million of provisions as the global economy recovered from the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, in----             the first three months of this year HSBC's earnings were dented by $642 million of new expected----             credit losses.--------TD----             The new expected losses included about $250 million tied to Russian borrowers, and some $160----             million linked to China's property sector -- against which it had also taken charges in the previous----             quarter. Still, HSBC's profit rose on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and beat analysts' consensus----             forecasts, as the credit-loss charges came in below expectations.--------             Revenue fell 4% from a year ago to $12.5 billion, undershooting expectations. The bank said this----             figure was reduced by $342 million of "market impacts" in life insurance, as weak stock markets----             reduced the value of that business's share portfolio. HSBC said stringent Covid-19 restrictions and----             temporary branch closures in Hong Kong also weighed on its revenue for the quarter.--------             Chief Executive Noel Quinn said lending volumes were up across the bank, while its personal----             banking, insurance and trade finance businesses were showing good growth. "I'm encouraged by----             our start to the year," he said in a statement.--------             Mr. Quinn said despite economic uncertainty, rising interest rates had made the bank more----             confident of being able to generate a 10%-plus return on tangible equity next year.--------             Lenders like HSBC can earn higher profit margins on loans when interest rates are higher. In recent----             months government bond yields and interbank lending rates have surged, as the U.S. Federal----             Reserve and other central banks have begun tightening monetary policy to combat rapid inflation.--------             Government bond prices have tumbled this year, pushing yields up sharply.

That is still above its target of 12.5%, and Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said it----           would be maintained as the bank generates higher income.--------           He also said competition for talent was putting pressure on the bank's payroll, although it still----           managed to lower costs by 4% in the quarter.--------           The bank reported an 18% rise in net profit for the quarter to €1.23 billion, the equivalent of $1.3----           billion—the highest in nine years. The profit was higher than an average analyst consensus of €1.11----           billion. Revenue at its corporate bank rose 11%, and 7% at its investment bank.--------           "The first quarter was about demonstrating our resilience," Mr. von Moltke said. In a message to staff,----           Chief Executive Christian Sewing said the global economic outlook was deteriorating, while inflation----           rates continued to rise.--------           Customers long turned off by the bank's troubles are returning, due to a focus on its core businesses----           and success at cutting costs. Revenue at its key fixed-income business rose 15%, outperforming----           most of its U.S. peers. Debt and equity origination, however, fell given the economic and geopolitical----           uncertainty.--------           Deutsche Bank has promised to meet a series of financial goals this year, but the bank's visibility over----           the rest of the year has been clouded by the war in Ukraine.--------           Deutsche Bank, like its European and U.S. lending peers, has reported a relatively small direct----           exposure to Russia and Ukraine. It said its gross loan exposure to Russia stood at €1.3 billion, much----           of it guaranteed. But the war has triggered an increase in commodity and energy prices, and fears of----           an economic slowdown in the continent that would hurt borrowers.--------           The bank increased provisions for bad loans in the quarter to €292 million, compared with €69 million----           a year ago.--------           Mr. von Moltke said the bank wasn't seeing any borrower trouble so far. But the bank warned in its----           results report that sudden and deeper interest-rate increases by central banks in response to high----           inflation could cause a "sharply negative reaction in financial markets and most likely a significant----           economic recession in the U.S. as well as in Europe."------------           The bank, which for years struggled with a combination of financial scandals, fines and low----           profitability, has been improving its prospects under an overhaul that Mr. Sewing began in 2019,----           shortly after it dropped a bid to merge with smaller rival Commerzbank AG.--------           Under Mr. Sewing's direction, it has cut costs, exited equities trading and vowed to focus on its----           strengths, including fixed-income trading and cash management.--------           It recently suffered a setback when U.S. investment firm Capital Group Cos. dumped its roughly 5%----           stake in the bank, months after another large investor, Cerberus Capital Management, sold its shares.--------           This year, it committed to deliver to investors a series of targets, including an 8% return on tangible----           equity—a key metric for profitability. It is also said it would reach a cost-to-income ratio, a measure of----           efficiency, of 70%.--------           In the first quarter, the return on equity stood at 8.1%. Its cost-to-income ratio was at 73.4%.--------           Write to Patricia Kowsmann at patricia.kowsmann@wsj.com--------           Deutsche Bank's Profit Rises on Strong Client Activity--------CO         deut : Deutsche Bank AG--------IN         ibnk : Banking/Credit | i81402 : Commercial Banking | i814 : Banking | ifinal : Financial Services | iibnk----           : Integrated Banks----NS         c15 : Financial Performance | c151 : Earnings | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | ncolu : Columns |----           ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter----RE         russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | uk : United Kingdom | ukrn :----           Ukraine | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging----           Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz :----           Western Europe----IPD        Wires--------IPC        CBK.XE--------PUB        Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN         Document WSJO000020220427ei4r000gp------------------------CLM     WSJ Podcast What's News----HD      Why India Is Staying Neutral on the Ukraine War--------WC      2,238 words----PD      27 April 2022----ET      15:40----SN      WSJ Podcasts----SC      WSJPOD----LA      English----CY      Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

U.S. efforts to convince countries around the world to isolate Russia politically----        and economically have hit a snag in India. And it's not for lack of trying. WSJ South Asia correspondent----        Shan Li explains why American overtures have so far gone unanswered in New Delhi, thanks to India's----        reliance on Russian arms, regional security concerns and decades of lingering distrust. Luke Vargas----        hosts.--------        Click here to listen to the podcast--------TD----        Luke Vargas : Russia threatens to cut gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria in a warning shot to the rest----        of Europe. Plus why America's global campaign to isolate Russia has hit a snag in India.--------        Shan Li : A huge percentage of their military equipment is from Russia. They also want to keep Russia----        on their side in any sort of future border conflict with China.--------        Luke Vargas : And Brazil takes on sky high credit card interest rates. It's Wednesday, April 27th. I'm----        Luke Vargas with The Wall Street Journal. Here's the AM edition of What's News, the top headlines and----        business stories moving your world today.--------        Russia has said in letters by state owned energy company, Gazprom, that it will halt gas supplies to----        Poland and Bulgaria beginning today, following through on a threat to cut off countries that don't pay for----        their gas on new wartime terms outlined in March by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The move marks----        a major escalation by Russia, which has tried to bolster its currency by insisting customers pay for gas in----        Rubles. And WSJ reporter Georgi Kantchev in Berlin says Russia's latest move introduces the possibility----        that more economies in Europe could be targeted.--------        Georgi Kantchev: This can be seen as a warning shot, as escalation by Moscow. So it sets a dangerous----        president for a place like Germany, like Austria, like Italy, some of the bigger European Union members.----        And it remains to be seen if they don't pay in Rubles, which most of those countries have said they----        wouldn't, what happens next? Will Russia cut off gas to those countries as well? This would be quite a----        significant move. It would cause severe economic consequences for the European economy.--------        Luke Vargas : European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described Russia's threat to halt----        gas supplies as blackmail that demonstrated Russia's unreliability as a gas supplier. She added that a----        meeting of the block's gas coordination group was underway.--------        Credit Suisse has announced changes to its management team, including its Asia head chief financial----        officer and general counsel, as it reported a first quarter loss of around $284 million. The Swiss bank's----        challenges include losses associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and legal charges that amounted----        to $730 million for the quarter.--------        And we are exclusively reporting that toy maker, Mattel, has held talks with private equity firms about a----        potential sale according to people familiar with the matter. Mattel, the maker of Barbie, Hot Wheels and----        Fisher-Price toys has held informal talks with firms, including Apollo Global Management and L Catterton----        according to those sources. The talks are at an early stage and may not result in a deal. The company is----        scheduled to report first quarter earnings later today.------------        Imagine if your credit card's average annual interest rate was 346%. That is what many borrowers in----        Brazil have to contend with, and it's leading Brazil's government, central bank and regulators to try and----        provide relief. WSJ reporter Jeffrey Lewis joins us from Sao Paulo to discuss how we arrived at this----        point. Jeffrey, thanks so much for being with us.--------        Jeffrey Lewis : Hi, good to be here.--------        Luke Vargas : So Jeffrey, what is going on here? Why are these credit rates in Brazil just so high?--------        Jeffrey Lewis : Well, it's really a combination of reasons. One thing is just that inflation is high at the----        moment, for instance, above 11%, the 12 month rate for March. So the key lending rate from the central----        bank is now pretty high. It's 11 or 12%. But the historical reason is that there's just sort of a lack of----        competition among the big banks. The top three banks here have close to 80% of total deposits. I think----        it's about 36% in the US. And also there's no sort of credit rating system here. For instance, if you want----        to borrow money, you basically have to stick with the bank that you've been working with your whole life,----        because they're the other ones who have your credit history.--------        Luke Vargas : Okay. So what can Brazil Central Bank and its regulators do to bring these rates down----        and are they doing those things?--------        Jeffrey Lewis : Well, the main thing that the central bank has been doing for several years now has been----        trying to just introduce more competition into the financial system. They already started making it easier----        for fintechs to open up and that's already had an impact. And now of course, they've moved on with open----        finance where they're requiring banks to share their information, to share borrowers' income histories,----        credit histories, et cetera, with each other. And the idea of that is that it's going to also help bring down----        costs for companies and for individuals. This isn't just about credit card rates. This is about any kind of----        borrowing.--------        Luke Vargas : And Steven finally, until these rates can be brought down, what effect is that having on----        Brazil's economy, its competitiveness? And what effect is it having for average Brazilians?--------        Jeffrey Lewis : Well, I mean, of course it creates distortions and it slows economic growth. I mean,----        central banks, the way they control inflation is by raising and lowering the cost of borrowing. And so here----        in Brazil with these high interest rates, it deters businesses from investing. You've got great big----        companies, you've got Petrobras, you've got (Vale), that if they want to borrow money for an investment----        in Brazil, they can go abroad. But if you've got a small business, then you're kind of stuck. I mean, you----        have to borrow here. And so any investment in your business is going to be just that much more----        expensive. And so you might hold off because it is just not going to pay off.--------        Luke Vargas : That was WSJ reporter Jeffrey Lewis, joining us from Sao Paulo. Jeff, thanks for the----        update.--------        Jeffrey Lewis : Thanks for having me on.--------        Luke Vargas : Coming up, as the US attempts to isolate Russia politically and economically, it's finding it----        difficult to convince India to come off the sidelines. We'll hear from our reporter in New Delhi about why----        India is staying neutral in the conflict, despite its strong ties with the US after the break.--------        A succession of US officials have traveled to New Delhi recently to persuade India to join Washington in----        its effort to isolate Russia. But they haven't succeeded as the world's largest democracy has stayed----        neutral in the conflict abstaining from United Nations votes to condemn Russia's actions and declining to----        join sanctions. So why is that? And what, if anything, can Washington do about it? WSJ South Asia----        correspondent, Shan Li joins us now from New Delhi to find out. Hey Shan, thanks for being with us.--------        Shan Li : Thanks Luke.--------        Luke Vargas : All right, so what has the US been asking India specifically, vis-a-vis Russia and Ukraine,----        and what has their response been so far?--------        Shan Li : Well, the US has been pushing India, lobbying India to take a harder stance on Russia, to----        openly publicly denounce Moscow for instigating the war in Ukraine, and also to if not join in the Western----        sanctions, economic sanctions against Russia, to then at least not actively, for example, purchase more----        crude oil from Russia, which India has been doing over the last few months. And basically trying to either----        push them to denounce Russia or at least not get in the way of Western sanctions.--------        Luke Vargas : And what have they said to that?--------------------        Shan Li : And in response, India has kind of gone its own way. It's remained neutral on Ukraine and----        Russia. It's one of the last major world powers to remain neutral. They've put out statements denouncing----        the violence in Ukraine, but they haven't specifically called out Russia, they haven't called out Putin and----        they've remained kind of invalidly neutral on the war, despite a lot of pressure from Western countries.--------        Luke Vargas : Shan, the US and India are close trading partners and increasingly so close security----        partners. Why then is the US struggling to bring India around here?--------        Shan Li : So immediately there's a couple of very practical, pragmatic reasons why India has remained----        neutral. So a huge percentage of their military equipment is from Russia. So from 2016 to 2020, nearly----        50% of their military equipment came from Russia. So they rely on Russia for not only new arms, but----        also repair, spare parts to repair their existing equipment.--------        The other aspect that is number one crucial from India's strategic perspective is they want to keep----        Russia on their side in any sort of future border conflict with China. And India's just worried that if they----        alienate Moscow, then that will push Russia closer to China for any sort of future disputes.--------        However, like undergirding this sort of perspective on the Ukraine war is, and yet has actually had----        decades of quite close strategic ties to Russia going back to the Cold War. And they had very close----        relationships throughout the Cold War. And Russia has backed India and various conflicts over the years----        involving Pakistan, for example, which is India's arch nemesis, arch rival. And on the flip side, India's----        actually had a very tense, fraught relationship with the US over the years as well. A lot of that has to do----        with the US backing Pakistan for many decades. And that has resulted in a lot of lingering mistrust. I----        think a lot of resentment against the US and the West in general, that a lot of Indian government officials----        still feel.--------        Luke Vargas : Do you get the sense that American officials are becoming a little bit more understanding----        of India's position or are they just driving at this over and over with no result?--------        Shan Li : So that's actually quite interesting. I would say that now a lot of American officials understand.----        That was not the case when the war first broke out. In talking to sources and talking to Western----        diplomats or American officials, some of them expressed quite a lot of surprise when the war first broke----        out and India adopted this neutral stance. I think the thought process was India is the world's largest----        democracy. Of course, they would take the side against Russia and for Ukraine. However, I think a lot of----        these officials either didn't quite understand the long history between India, Russia and the West. Or if----        they knew this very complicated history, they didn't understand how deeply emotional of an issue it still----        is. So now actually I think a lot of them have come around and fully understand the sort of underlying----        sentiment of distrust against the West. And now they understand that publicly pressuring India on the----        Ukraine issue is not effective.--------        So their argument over the last couple of months has changed from a more moral argument, which is----        India should be on the right side of history. It's the right thing to do. So they've toned down sort of more----        on the moral argument and are now stressing more of the pragmatic side, which is one, this----        over-reliance you can argue on Russian military equipment is not going to be for India's benefit for long----        term. And two, this kind of strategy that India is playing to keep Russia on its side in any sort of future----        conflict with China, there is no way that Russia is going to side with India in any sort of future conflict with----        China.--------        So those are two of the main points that American officials are now making when they're talking to the----        Indian side. And I think those are more effective points to make. And it's something that in talking to----        Indian officials, they are fully aware of now. And they are looking into increasing domestic manufacturing----        of military equipment, and are looking into diversifying purchases, maybe buy more US arms. The big----        sticking point is that it's way more expensive to buy military equipment from the US, for example, than----        from Russia. The Russian arms is just way cheaper. So the price factor is very important.--------        Luke Vargas : That was WSJ South Asia correspondent Shan Li, joining us from New Delhi.

China Wants to Weaken Them.--------BY      By Christopher S. Tang----WC      875 words----PD      27 April 2022----ET      13:30----SN      Barron's Online----SC      BON----LA      English----CY      Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----        About the author: Christopher S. Tang is a Distinguished Professor and the Edward W. Carter Chair at----        the UCLA Anderson School of Management--------        Western countries are in awe at how quickly U.S.-led financial sanctions severely damaged Russia's----        economy. But for those 35 countries that abstained from a U.N. vote condemning Russia's invasion of----        Ukraine, those repercussions will make them wary.--------TD----        This concern creates an opportunity for China to enhance the global appeal of the yuan and its financial----        architecture as alternatives. To preserve the power of its financial weapons, the U.S. should take steps----        to impede the adoption of Chinese payment systems.--------        The United States and its allies launched two financial weapons against Russia in late February. They----        barred Russia's central bank from accessing much of its $630 billion in foreign exchange and gold----        reserves. Then, they banned several Russian banks from conducting cross-border banking transactions----        via the SWIFT system—an interbank message system that facilitates payments worth $1.5 trillion daily.--------        To stabilize the falling ruble, The Central Bank of Russia initially raised its interest rate to 20%, the----        highest in almost twenty years. It is highly likely Russia will default on its foreign debt for the first time in----        over a century.--------        The power of these Western financial weapons are making other countries feel vulnerable. They may----        even support the Chinese payment mechanism as an alternative.--------        China's desire to break the dollar's hegemony over international trade is no secret, even though there is----        no practical alternative to the U.S. dollar in the short term. However, several forces empower China to----        develop a "salami slicing" strategy to reduce the dominance of the U.S. dollar and the SWIFT system.--------        In 2015, China launched its Cross-Border Interbank Payment System to facilitate international trade in----        its own currency. As of 2021, CIPS was primarily used for transactions between Hong Kong and the----        mainland, and some marginal use in Africa, Latin America, and Europe. Global cross-border payment----        and settlement are dominated by the U.S. dollar and the euro, while CIPS has 3.2% market share by----        value.--------        In the short term, CIPS is not a contender to replace SWIFT even if CIPS can develop its own----        communication channel. However, China can use its economic and political power to encourage other----        countries to trade in yuan instead of U.S. dollars. China's Belt and Road initiative is paying dividends.----        Several African countries including Ghana and Nigeria are using the yuan as part of their settlement----        and reserve currency.--------        Immediately after the sanctions became effective, Russia accepted yuan for some of its coal and oil----        exports. Israel added the yuan to its reserve holding for the first time while cutting its U.S. dollar----        holdings, and Saudi Arabia is considering accepting the yuan for oil sales.--------------------        The People's Bank of China is also exploring cross-border payments by using its recently launched----        digital yuan. This trend can pave the path for more cross-border payment and settlement in yuan as an----        alternative to the dollar and the euro, driving more international institutions to adopt CIPS as an----        alternative to SWIFT.--------        To counteract China's salami slicing strategy, the U.S. and Europe could consider taking three----        preemptive moves.--------        First, calm some nerves. The U.S., European Union, and their allies need to clarify the conditions under----        which a country's foreign reserves can be frozen and its access to SWIFT blocked. Showing these----        conditions are designed for black swan events, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine, will help put at ease----        those countries that did not support the sanctions against Russia.--------        Second, invest in technology. Despite its popularity, the SWIFT system is archaic, inflexible, and slow,----        and it has lately been prone to cyberattacks. There is an urgent need to upgrade or replace SWIFT with----        a more secure digital interbank message system using blockchain technology. Besides upgrading----        SWIFT, the U.S. should expedite its development of a digital dollar to make cross-border payments----        faster and cheaper.--------        Third, get a seat at the table. Although U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo became the latest----        senior official to reject joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific----        Partnership in late 2021, the U.S. should reconsider doing it anyway. As a CPTPP member, the U.S.----        could use its economic and political influence to discourage other members from trading in yuan and----        adopting CIPS.--------        To counterbalance China's economic and political influence in Africa through its Belt and Road initiative,----        the United States and EU must deepen their engagementwith African countries through stronger----        infrastructure development projects as well as the U.N. Millenium Project.--------        Deglobalization would lessen the dominance of U.S. financial weapons. But with strategic effort, the----        United States can stay on top.--------        Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's and MarketWatch----        newsroom.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          Russia's top diplomat said the West was engaged in a proxy war with his country that could escalate----          into a global conflict with nuclear weapons, as Western nations elevated their commitment to helping----          Ukraine defend itself.--------          "The risk is serious, real. It should not be underestimated," Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of Russia----          said in a Russian state-television interview broadcast Monday night. "Under no circumstances should----          a third world war be allowed to happen," he said, adding that "there can be no winners in a nuclear----          war."--------TD----          Mr. Lavrov said the West was increasing the risk of a bigger conflict by providing arms to Ukraine:----          "NATO is, in essence, going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy."--------          U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Tuesday, said----          "any bluster about the possible use of nuclear weapons is dangerous and unhelpful."--------          Mr. Austin met with defense officials from more than 40 countries in Germany on Tuesday and said----          the U.S. and its allies would continue to meet Ukraine's needs, adding that the stakes of the conflict----          "reach beyond Ukraine and even Europe."--------          President Vladimir Putin of Russia has repeatedly raised the specter of nuclear war, invoking his----          country's atomic arsenal in an effort to deter the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from----          getting involved in the conflict.--------          The West, meanwhile, has accelerated efforts to bolster Ukraine with fresh supplies of weapons and----          ammunition in a bid to thwart Russia, but the U.S. and NATO have said they won't deploy troops into----          direct combat.--------          Russia's attempt to oust Ukraine's elected government through a rapid military invasion at the end of----          February failed, and Moscow is now focusing on trying to seize territory in Ukraine's east with the help----          of mass artillery and aerial bombardments. Russian units were pushing southwest from the city of----          Izyum and attacking the village of Barvinskove, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on----          Tuesday.--------          On Tuesday, Germany said it would refurbish and send to Ukraine decommissioned antiaircraft----          cannon tanks known as Flakpanzer Gepard, or Cheetah, ending its longstanding reluctance to give----          tanks to the country. Germany will provide about 50 of the German-made self-propelled guns, marking----          a major delivery of non-Soviet weapons systems by a Western country to Ukraine, two government----          officials said.--------          Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany said last week his government was treading carefully to avoid a----          nuclear war.--------          The U.K. signaled a more aggressive stance on Tuesday when a junior U.K. defense minister, James----          Heappey, said it was "completely legitimate" for Ukraine to use Western weapons to hit logistics and----          supply lines in Russia.------------          For months, the U.K. has provided weapons on the proviso that they are used to defend Ukraine from----          Russian attack rather than offensively.--------          "Things that the international community are now providing to Ukraine have the range to be used over----          the borders," Mr. Heappey, who is U.K. minister for the armed forces, told Times Radio. "That is not----          necessarily a problem."--------          Mr. Austin said Ukraine has received more than $5 billion of equipment to defend against Russian----          forces, including two U.S. packages of military aid worth $800 million each.--------          President Biden has said the administration would soon submit a request to Congress for more----          funding for Ukraine.--------          U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken testified on Tuesday on the administration's budget blueprint----          and told senators that "fully funding it is critical, in my judgment, to ensuring that Russia's war in----          Ukraine is a strategic failure for the Kremlin and serves as a powerful lesson to those who might----          consider following its path."--------          A day earlier, Mr. Austin said the U.S. aims to see Russia's military capabilities degraded and----          Ukraine's strengthened to prevent Moscow from attempting to conquer territory by force in the future.--------          "We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in----          invading Ukraine," Mr. Austin said after he and Mr. Blinken became the highest-level U.S. officials to----          visit Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, since Russia invaded Ukraine Feb. 24.--------          Mr. Austin's Tuesday meeting with defense ministers at Ramstein Air Base included Ukraine's Oleksii----          Reznikov, and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. The topics on the agenda included----          updating the officials about the latest intelligence from the battlefield, security assistance and----          strengthening NATO's defense-industrial base in the long term to support Ukraine's defense, a----          defense official said.--------          Speaking after the conference, Mr. Austin said U.S. and European officials attending agreed to meet----          monthly, either virtually or in person, to discuss ways to support Ukraine.--------          Russia, meanwhile, said it would halt gas flows to Poland and Bulgaria starting on Wednesday, the----          first time Moscow has followed through on a threat to cut off countries that don't pay for their gas on----          new, wartime terms.--------          On the diplomatic front, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met with met with----          Messrs. Putin and Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday.--------          Mr. Guterres called for group-led humanitarian corridors, particularly in the southern Ukrainian port----          city of Mariupol, and for a swift end to the war. Mr. Putin denied there were problems with civilian----          evacuations, state-run news agency Ria Novosti reported. The U.N.'s refugee agency now estimates----          that 8.3 million people will flee Ukraine by year's end, up from its forecasts in early March.--------          Mr. Guterres is scheduled to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in Kyiv on Thursday.--------          In a telephone call on Tuesday with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Mr. Putin said the----          last remaining Ukrainian troops in Mariupol would be spared and offered medical attention if they----          surrendered to the Russian occupying forces, the Kremlin said. Ukrainian officials have claimed that----          there are up to 2,000 Ukrainian fighters and over 1,000 civilians holed up in the Azovstal steel----          complex.--------          Mr. Putin told Mr. Erdogan that Mariupol, which has suffered immense death and destruction after two----          months of Russian shelling, was now entirely under Russian control, the Kremlin said.--------          In his Monday interview, Mr. Lavrov said there has been no progress in peace talks with Kyiv, but that----          the conflict would end in a treaty that would depend on the situation on the ground. A senior U.S.----          official on Monday said the U.S. aimed to ensure that Ukraine "has the strongest possible hand" in----          any such peace negotiations.--------          Russia has removed some of its forces from around cities in northern Ukraine and focused instead on----          the eastern Donbas region, in a high-stakes conflict on wide-open terrain.--------          As Mr. Putin's army has faced fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces strengthened by large infusions----          of Western weaponry, concerns have grown that Russia could consider using a so-called tactical----          nuclear weapon to gain the upper hand on the battlefield.------------          -----------          Bojan Pancevski, Max Colchester and Nancy A.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          VELYKYI BOBRYK, Ukraine -- Columns of Russian armor streamed past this village in northeastern----          Ukraine, with its reed-fringed lake and a blue-domed church, on the first day of the war. For three----          weeks, it was left alone.--------          The Russians came back on March 16, this time looking for anyone with mobile-phone footage or----          anything else that Ukrainian insurgents might have used in a spate of hit-and-run attacks on their----          supply lines. A tank had been destroyed nearby. Russian soldiers had killed the attacker, a local man----          named Ivan Demidov. They then went house to house through Velykyi Bobryk looking for potential----          accomplices before withdrawing from here and the rest of northern Ukraine in late March.--------TD----          Only the wrecks of Russian tanks and army rations serve as a reminder of their presence here. But----          gone with the Russians were six local men, who are among the growing number of people who have----          disappeared from villages and towns across Ukraine.--------          "The Russians have taken my brother away, and we have no idea where he is, what happened to him.----          Is he alive? Is he dead? Nothing," said Natalia Honcharuk, who works in a village grocery store. "Mama----          keeps calling authorities every day and nobody can tell us anything."--------          During their 10-day occupation of Velykyi Bobryk, which had a prewar population of about 1,000----          people, Russian forces didn't engage in the kind of killings that marked their stay in towns like Bucha,----          near Kyiv.--------          But during the occupation, the Ukrainian resistance encouraged locals to pass on images and GPS----          coordinates of Russian positions and convoys. The information was then used to organize ambushes----          or coordinate strikes by long-range artillery or Turkish-supplied Bayraktar TB2 drones.--------          "Every old lady in every village would send us photos of Russian convoys. Everyone was helping us,"----          said Ihor, a Ukrainian intelligence-service official in the regional capital of Sumy who isn't allowed to----          disclose his surname.--------          In Velykyi Bobryk, residents created a neighborhood messaging group using the Viber app, sharing----          news about Russian movements in the area and sometimes photos of Russian convoys. When----          Russian troops began searching the village, the first thing they demanded to see was the residents'----          smartphones. The Viber group was quickly disbanded, but some of the images had auto-downloaded----          onto residents' phones.--------          Ms. Honcharuk, who lived with her mother and her brother, Serhiy, 45 years old, said she gladly----          showed the Russians her smartphone, which didn't have anything illicit. She said her brother, who was----          sickly after two severe bouts of Covid-19, owned just an old phone without a camera or internet----          access. The Russians didn't believe him. "Why are you lying!" they shouted as they dragged Serhiy out----          of the house, put him atop an armored personnel carrier -- a common tactic of using civilians to thwart----          attacks -- and drove him to their camp.--------         Ms. Honcharuk said she tried to look for her brother two days later at a Russian checkpoint, but by----         then a different group of Russian troops was there. They told her that her brother was in Boromlya, the----         nearest town where Russian troops had set up an interrogation facility in a local egg-packaging factory.--------         "They said, he will be investigated by competent organs and then sent back home, don't worry," Ms.----         Honcharuk said. "Now I understand they were telling everyone the same thing."--------         On the other side of the village, the first Russian search went well, thought Vita Yurinova. The----         36-year-old, who likes to get around on a bicycle, lives in one of Velykyi Bobryk's nicer homes with her----         mother-in-law and two daughters. Her husband, Viktor, 48, worked as a truck driver.--------         "Will you shoot us?" Ms. Yurinova said she asked when Russian troops first appeared at their gate.----         "No, we won't," the Russians replied. They searched the closets, the kitchen, the shed, the cellar and,----         after finding nothing incriminating, proceeded to the next house, she said.--------         The next morning, Ms. Yurinova said she saw a black Russian drone hovering over her courtyard. At----         about 11:30 a.m., a Russian armored personnel carrier roared up to their gate. Several soldiers with----         guns at the ready pushed in and one of them showed a phone, confiscated from another villager, with----         photographs of Mr. Demidov and two other men.--------         "Demidov, we already killed him," the soldier said. "Who are the other two with him? Why did they have----         to kill two of our tank crew?" When Mr. Yurinov said he didn't know the two men, the soldier cursed and----         hit him, Ms. Yurinova said.--------         As the Russians led away Ms. Yurinova's husband, they started interrogating her in the courtyard. One----         of them cracked a joke about their age discrepancy. "What use can you have for an old man like that?"----         he asked.--------         Less than an hour later, the Russians returned to detain Ms. Yurinova. In their headquarters, the----         basement of a grocery and coffee shop near the church on the main square, an interrogator scrutinized----         her phone. He found a photo of a friend wearing a military uniform and the number for a Territorial----         Defense member. He also found a photo of a Russian convoy that was auto-downloaded from the----         neighborhood messaging group.--------         "Shall we have our way with her?" one of the soldiers said, Ms. Yurinova recalled. "No way, look at her,----         she looks too old and haggard," another said. Instead, he suggested bringing Ms. Yurinova's----         16-year-old daughter to the base. She said she pleaded with the guards to leave her daughter alone.--------         The Russians then brought Ms. Yurinova out of the basement. Her husband was outside on his knees,----         his mouth sealed with duct tape, his hands tied, his nose bloodied and broken. Three other villagers----         were in the same group, with one of them trying to persuade the troops that he hadn't meant any ill----         intent in taking a snapshot of the convoy. A Russian soldier kicked Mr. Yurinov, another fired a bullet----         into the ground, she said.--------         She was then separated from the others, waiting in the dark of the basement until she was released----         around 2:30 p.m. "Go home and educate your children, not in the Nazi propaganda you have been fed,----         but to be normal people," a soldier told her.--------         By then, Ms. Yurinova's husband and the other prisoners were gone.--------         Russian troops also came to Nadia Velichenko's home. "Are there any Nazis in the house?" she----         recalled them asking. They took her son, Yuli, away the next day after learning he had previously----         fought with Ukraine's military against pro-Russian forces in the Donbas region of Ukraine.--------         "Mother, if his hands are not stained by blood, we will let him go," she recalled the Russians telling her----         as they drove off with her son.--------         Hungry Russian soldiers begun breaking into empty local homes and into shops, taking everything they----         could. At the store where Ms. Honcharuk worked, owner Yevhen Demchenko said losses and----         damages topped $10,000.--------         Ms. Yurinova continued asking Russian troops about her husband. On March 24, she was told to----         inquire with a Russian officer who went by the name Travel and operated out of Velykyi Bobryk's----         school.--------         "Don't worry, he is in Belgorod," the Russian city about three hours drive away, Travel told her after----         making inquiries, she said. "If he is innocent, he will be freed, and if he's not he will be traded in a----         prisoner exchange."--------         "How can I not worry?" Ms. Yurinova retorted, saying that her husband suffers from thyroid and liver----         disease.--------         Meanwhile, Russian forces had stepped up their sweep of their area.--------         At their interrogation site at the packaging factory in Boromlya, Russian troops used sophisticated----         equipment to examine detainees' phones and ran their names through intelligence databases, the----         town's mayor said.--------         In the nearby village of Hrebenykivka, a resident whom The Wall Street Journal agreed to identify by----         his first name Serhiy, was picked up on March 14 along with four other men and taken for interrogation----         across the border in Belgorod about possible connections with the Ukrainian resistance. While three----         men still remain in Russian captivity, Serhiy said he and another villager were cleared and sent back to----         Ukraine on March 21, where they were taken to the interrogation site in Boromlya while waiting to be----         taken back to Hrebenykivka.--------         There he shared the basement with Mr. Yurinov and four other detainees from Velykyi Bobryk before----         they, too, were taken to Belgorod, he said. They were in bad shape, Serhiy said.--------         "One had a gunshot in the foot, one had a torn and broken nose after they dragged him with a hook,----         another had torn ears. They had been beaten into pulp," he recalled.--------         The Russian soldiers, by then, were fearful of constant ambushes and were taking it out on their----         prisoners. Ukrainian forces recaptured Trostyanets, the next town down the road from Boromlya, on----         March 25. Much of the central square there is still full of burned-out Russian armor and trash left by the----         retreating Russian soldiers, who spray-painted slurs about President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine----         on several buildings.--------         The following day, the Russians left Velykyi Bobryk as part of a wider withdrawal from northern----         Ukraine.--------         Residents wrote "Glory to Ukraine" once again on the side of a central shop by the church where the----         Russians had painted over the previous version of the slogan. Someone had put a sign on the road----         saying "Marauders' street" where the Russians used to have their headquarters.--------         "Occupation was such a terrible thing, it's as if they strangle you and cut off the oxygen," said Natalia----         Varyonova, 47, as she was restocking the empty central shop with freshly arrived supplies. "Thank----         God we have survived this, we are a strong nation. I hope they never come back here."--------         Ms. Velichenko, tearing up, said she had been told that her son had been taken to Russia and his----         name had been put on a list of prisoners eligible for exchange. It was unknown when he might be----         traded.--------         Ms. Yurinova said she was heartened by a recent call from Serhiy, the man who was imprisoned with----         her husband in Boromlya.--------         "At least we know that my husband is alive," she said. "Now we just sit by the phone, waiting for----         someone to call." As she showed a faded photo of her husband, her 16-year-old daughter, Katya,----         thrust forward her iPhone. "Please have a look at this one instead. My daddy doesn't look like that old----         photograph anymore," she said.--------         Ms. Honcharuk said she still has no news of her brother.--------         License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------NS       gvio : Military Action | npag : Page One Stories | gcat : Political/General News | gcns : National/Public----         Security | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content Types----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----         Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe | ussrz :----         CIS Countries----IPC      IGV--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document J000000020220427ei4r0001q------------------------HD       Ukraine Needs Far More Firepower--------BY       By Bing West----WC       580 words----PD       27 April 2022----SN       The Wall Street Journal----SC       J----PG       A15----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

"They believe that we can win; we believe that they can win if they have the right equipment,----         the right support." Yet U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization aid to Ukraine has been too little, too----         late.--------         The war is being waged in the air, on sea and on land. The air war was conceded to Russia a month----         ago when President Biden, unnerved by Vladimir Putin's threats, vetoed the transfer of Polish MiGs to----         Ukraine. With Russia bombing civilians daily, that timorous decision must be reversed.--------TD----         At sea, Russian ships bombarded Ukraine, while U.S. warships pulled out of the Black Sea. Ukraine----         can't export grain without NATO protection. In 1987 President Reagan ordered the escort of oil tankers----         in the Persian Gulf and successfully deterred Iranian attacks. At some point, Mr. Biden must deploy----         U.S. warships to assure freedom of the seas.--------         The immediate crisis is the ground battle in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. is providing 90 artillery pieces----         and 144,000 shells, a small quantity likely to be expended quickly. In the August 1944 attack on----         Saint-Malo, France (14 square miles), the U.S. Army fired 45,000 shells. In a single day in October----         1944, 18,000 shells struck the mid-size city of Aachen, Germany. During peak bombardments against----         Grozny in 1995, estimates are that the Russians fired 4,000 an hour. In a few months in 2017, Marine----         howitzers fired 35,000 shells at ISIS targets.--------         The arithmetic of battle in any war is one of large, large numbers. In the Vietnam War, Moscow showed----         it understood that. In contrast to our aid to Ukraine, the Soviet Union massively supplied North Vietnam----         with offensive weapons -- 400 MiGs, 2,000 tanks, 7,000 artillery pieces and more than 5,000 antiaircraft----         guns. In 1968, in two weeks at our remote Khe Sanh base, we dropped 40,000 artillery shells and 1,000----         tons of bombs upon attacking North Vietnamese. Outside Khe Sanh, the enemy trapped my----         reconnaissance patrol. To get us out, in less than two hours the Marines fired 20,000 pounds of high----         explosives, followed by two 2,000-pound bombs. Those heavy fires were in support of only five men.--------         Russia will sit at the border and launch hundreds of thousands of shells into Ukraine. Ukraine must----         strike back at gun positions and munitions sites inside Russia. No sanctuary can be granted. This is a----         war with sledgehammers. Ukrainians can't retake cities in the east and south without massive support ------         far beyond the paltry aid the allies have supplied to date. Since the war began, the U.S. and NATO----         have given Kyiv about $4 billion in military aid, while the European nations have paid Russia $38 billion----         for hydrocarbons.--------         Having conceded control of the air, the odds of Ukraine taking back the cities held by the Russians are----         low, and approach zero without massive artillery. Ukraine doesn't have the weapons or stockpiles of----         munitions for the slugfest that has begun. The U.S. and NATO must urgently provide $40 billion in----         military aid, not $4 billion.--------         -----------         Mr. West, a former assistant secretary of defense and combat Marine, is author of a dozen books about----         Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.------------         License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------CO       nato : North Atlantic Treaty Organization--------NS       gvio : Military Action | nedc : Commentaries/Opinions | gcat : Political/General News | gcns :----         National/Public Security | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E----         Executive News Filter----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----         Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe | ussrz :----         CIS Countries----IPC      IGV--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document J000000020220427ei4r0001d------------------------HD         The Ukraine Crisis: Lawmakers Will Shift To Provide Long-Term U.S. Aid--------BY         By Natalie Andrews, Andrew Duehren and William Mauldin----WC         561 words----PD         27 April 2022----SN         The Wall Street Journal----SC         J----PG         A7----LA         English----CY         Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

With the war continuing to rage, the White House is----           expected to send a supplemental request to Congress for a second multibillion-dollar aid package by----           the end of the week, aides and lawmakers said.--------TD----           "We're just waiting for the administration to state that number," said Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.).--------           Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) called the conflict a war of "tyranny vs. democracy----           itself," and said the U.S. "has a moral obligation to help the Ukrainian people with the tools they----           need, for as long as they need them." He didn't provide timing or details on a vote.--------           Republicans said they also are on board, but want Democratic leaders to keep the Ukraine spending----           package separate from other pending agenda items, such as a stalled package funding Covid-19----           vaccines and treatments, which has been caught up in a border-policy dispute.--------           "I'm concerned that Chuck Schumer and [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi will try to politicize this by----           combining it with something that may not be attractive for Republicans, then somehow blame----           Republicans that they don't support aid for Ukraine," said Sen. Steve Daines (R., Mont.).--------           "The key is more, more of everything," said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), adding the U.S. should----           send "whatever they need in terms of economic assistance and military assistance."--------           On nonmilitary aid, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko said in an interview with The Wall----           Street Journal that he is seeking $2 billion a month in U.S. economic support to cover the next three----           months. The Biden administration has released $1 billion in funds to help Ukraine pay for basic----           government services and public employees' salaries.--------           "We want this bridge to the new normal, we are not seeking how to cover all expenses to the end of----           the year," he said.--------           Lawmakers returned this week after a two-week recess with a renewed focus to help the embattled----           country, which Russia invaded in February.

He had resisted the move, which he said on----           Friday could trigger a nuclear war with Russia.--------           While several European allies have pledged to send Soviet-era armored vehicles to Ukraine, this----           would be one of the first examples of a country providing Western-made equipment.--------           Ms. Lambrecht announced the decision at a meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense----           ministers on Tuesday at the U.S.'s Ramstein Air Base in Germany.--------           The Gepard self-propelled antiaircraft cannons were removed from service more than a decade ago----           and are stored by their manufacturer, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann GmbH, a German company military----           experts say makes some of the world's most advanced tanks.--------           Ukraine approached KMW and other leading German arms manufacturers and requested contracts----           for heavy hardware such as tanks and antiaircraft systems. Most of these orders would be paid for by----           Ukraine, which receives funds from NATO allies to boost its defenses. In the case of the Gepard----           systems, Germany would pay for the entire deal, Ms. Lambrecht said.--------           The government will allow the firm to export the weapons to Ukraine, the officials said.--------           KMW was in talks with Ukraine about the transaction before the war broke out, and has long awaited----           export permission from Berlin, say people familiar with the negotiations.--------           "Our tanks are in good shape, and they can be delivered very, very quickly," a KMW spokesman said.--------           As of Tuesday, the company, which also offers training and maintenance for its products, hadn't----           received government-export approval, said the spokesman. Such a procedure could be initiated----           swiftly, he said.----------------           Other leading German arms manufacturers also have sought permission from Berlin to send heavy----           weapons, said people familiar with the discussions.--------           German ministers earlier approved the supply of smaller arms to Ukraine. Berlin also agreed to----           supply German-made weapons systems to NATO nations that formerly were aligned with Moscow----           and still have Soviet hardware that Ukrainian troops easily can integrate into their arsenal.--------           The Gepards' complexity means providing training and maintenance to allow the Ukrainians to----           effectively use the tanks would take longer, but they will be useful in what is shaping up to be a long----           conflict, said Gustav Gressel, a military expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations.--------           Moreover, he said, the decision to allow the export of the Gepards could pave the way for further----           transfers of heavy arms to Ukraine because it eliminates Berlin's previous objections.--------           License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------CO         fgvger : Federal Government of Germany | nato : North Atlantic Treaty Organization--------IN         idef : Defense Equipment/Products | i364 : Aerospace Products/Parts | iindstrls : Industrial Goods |----           iaer : Aerospace/Defense----NS         gvexe : Executive Branch | gcat : Political/General News | gpol : Domestic Politics | gpir :----           Politics/International Relations | gvbod : Government Bodies----RE         ukrn : Ukraine | gfr : Germany | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | dach : DACH----           Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eecz :----           European Union Countries | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe | ussrz : CIS Countries |----           weurz : Western Europe----IPC        GEGV--------PUB        Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN         Document J000000020220427ei4r00015------------------------HD        The Ukraine Crisis: Russian Oil Sale Fails as Curbs Resonate --- State giant Rosneft strains to----          find buyers, pointing to impact of impending sanctions----BY        By Joe Wallace and Anna Hirtenstein----WC        602 words----PD        27 April 2022----SN        The Wall Street Journal----SC        J----PG        A8----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Many U.S. allies left oil and gas----          shipments out of their harshest sanctions on Russia. Importers in India and elsewhere swooped in to----          buy cheap Russian barrels at a time of rocketing energy prices.--------TD----          But exports hit a snag in recent days when Rosneft Oil Co. struggled to find buyers for enough oil to fill----          a fleet of tankers, traders familiar with the sale said. The producer, in which the government owns a----          large minority stake, invited companies to bid for the oil last week, according to traders and a----          document seen by The Wall Street Journal.--------          A Rosneft spokesman had no comment.--------          The problems with the sale give an early indication that European sanctions targeting Rosneft, and set----          to kick in on May 15, are starting to disrupt Russia's ability to move crude from oil fields to overseas----          buyers.--------          The sanctions are less stringent than a full ban on Russian imports. Many expect Europe eventually to----          adopt a phased outright ban on bringing in Russian oil -- an embargo promoted by newly re-elected----          French President Emmanuel Macron but resisted by Germany and Hungary, among other members.--------          But sanctions already in place, laid out by the European Union in mid-March, and replicated by----          Switzerland, will ban companies from reselling Rosneft oil outside Europe. This includes sales into the----          big Asian market, especially India, which has soaked up some of the Russian oil demand since----          Moscow invaded Ukraine.--------          Traders will still be able to bring Rosneft crude and refined products into the EU and Switzerland,----          which were exempted in order not to worsen a shortage of diesel and other fuels. But many----          companies in Europe are rapidly finding non-Russian sources of oil.--------          The sanctions also target Transneft, the sprawling state pipeline system that carries oil to ports,----          creating an additional hurdle to handling Russian fuel.--------          If Rosneft keeps struggling to sell, it would represent a further shock for an economy already locked----          out of much of Western finance and commerce. The company says it is Russia's biggest taxpayer,----          contributing a fifth of budget revenue. In total, Russia's oil and gas sales made up 45% of the federal----          budget in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency.--------          "If they can't sell, they'll have to start shutting down," said Adi Imsirovic, senior research fellow at the----          Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and former head of oil trading at a subsidiary of Gazprom PJSC.--------          Rosneft, run by longtime Putin ally Igor Sechin, last week invited bids for about 5.1 million metric tons----          of Urals -- or about 38 million barrels, enough to fill 19 large tankers -- according to the traders and------------          document. It asked for payment in rubles, an unusual twist, and said the oil would be loaded onto----          tankers at ports in the Baltic and Black seas in May and June. Smaller volumes of other kinds of crude----          -- including Siberian Light, Espo and Sokol -- were also on offer.--------          Reuters earlier reported about Rosneft's inability to sell the oil.--------          License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------CO        rsneft : Rosneft Oil Company OJSC | rosnft : Rosneftegaz--------IN        ifosfl : Fossil Fuels | i1 : Energy | i1300006 : Pipeline Transportation | iioil : Integrated Oil/Gas | i13 :----          Crude Oil/Natural Gas Upstream Operations | imidstr : Oil/Natural Gas Midstream Operations----NS        gesanc : International Sanctions | gtrade : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | neqac : Equities Asset Class----          News | m143 : Energy Markets | e51 : Trade/External Payments | ecat : Economic News | gcat :----          Political/General News | gdip : International Relations | gpir : Politics/International Relations | m14 :----          Commodity Markets | mcat : Commodity/Financial Market News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva----          Filters | nfce : C&E Exclusion Filter----RE        ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----          Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe | ussrz :----          CIS Countries----IPC       ABO--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document J000000020220427ei4r0000x------------------------CLM      World News----SE       World----HD       India's Neutrality on Ukraine Rooted in Deep Ties to Russia, Lingering Mistrust of U.S. American----         officials have struggled to overcome the dynamics of relationships built over decades----BY       By Shan Li and Rajesh Roy in New Delhi and Sabrina Siddiqui in Washington----WC       1,840 words----PD       26 April 2022----ET       17:11----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         A deputy U.S. national security adviser recently came to New Delhi to press India to take a more----         forceful stance against Russia over the Ukraine war. His meeting with the Indian foreign secretary was----         cordial, stressing the strong ties between Washington and New Delhi.--------         But Indian officials said they later felt blindsided when in public comments Daleep Singh warned of----         "consequences" for countries that helped circumvent sanctions. "Such words are never used in----         diplomacy," said one Indian official who was privy to the discussions. "It came as a surprise."--------TD----         A day later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov struck a very different tone after a meeting with his----         Indian counterpart, offering to sell India whatever it wanted to buy.--------         A succession of U.S. officials who have traveled to New Delhi to persuade India to join Washington in----         its effort to isolate Moscow have struggled to convince the country to come off the sidelines. India has----         stayed neutral in the conflict, abstaining from United Nations votes to condemn Russia's action and----         declining to join sanctions. India's position is partly born of necessity: Russia is its largest arms----         supplier. But it is also the result of lingering mistrust of Washington and an abiding confidence in----         Moscow's reliability that has been built over decades, Indian officials and analysts said.--------         During the Cold War, India adopted an official policy of nonalignment, but in reality forged an alliance----         with Russia, with the bonds growing closer as the U.S. backed rival countries such as Pakistan and----         imposed a slew of sanctions on New Delhi. Although ties with Washington have warmed over the years----         and Indian officials see a future in which the country is more closely aligned with the West, they say----         there remains a strong undercurrent of anti-American sentiment among Indian policy makers that is----         only reinforced when they are chastised publicly.--------         U.S. officials played down the comments from Mr. Singh, the U.S. deputy national security adviser for----         international economics, saying they weren't directed specifically at India and weren't intended to be a----         warning.--------         Still, Indian officials say remarks like those make them leery of turning their backs on Moscow, which----         has proven, time and again, to be a reliable partner. After a clash at the country's disputed border with----         China killed 20 Indian and four Chinese troops in 2020, India's defense minister visited Moscow twice----         within three months, partly to secure more arms and ammunition to bolster border defenses, according----         to an official with direct knowledge of the matter. In response, Russia supplied more missiles, tank parts----         and other weapons.--------         "Many people have the belief that Russian friendship has served India's interests when a crisis has----         erupted," said Syed Akbaruddin, former Indian permanent representative to the United Nations and----         dean of the Kautilya School of Public Policy in Hyderabad.--------         For the West, India is one of the last remaining holdouts among the world's major powers to remain----         neutral in the Ukraine war. The country's purchases of oil and other goods could diminish the impact of--------         sanctions designed to cripple the Russian economy. But perhaps more important, the Biden----         administration sees its relationship with India as one that will determine the future of security in Asia.----         "This is the one relationship we have to get right," said a State Department official.--------         India has spent billions of dollars on weapons from Russia, which has been its top arms supplier for----         decades. Despite efforts to diversify its sourcing, nearly 50% of its imported arms still came from----         Russia from 2016 to 2020.--------         In March, India struck a deal with Russia to purchase crude oil at a discount of at least 20% to global----         benchmark prices. Since the Ukraine war began, Indian refineries have purchased about 16 million----         barrels of Russian crude oil, with deliveries starting in May. That is close to the total amount imported----         from Russia in all of 2021, according to an Indian official.--------         The White House has stressed that cutting off Russian oil imports is a decision for India to make on its----         own. In a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month, President Biden said he----         didn't believe it was in India's interest to increase imports of Russian oil and reiterated that the U.S. was----         willing to help India diversify its energy sources.--------         U.S. officials say they have made progress with India in talks that have continued since the start of the----         war, pointing to Mr. Modi's recent comments condemning the killing of people in Bucha, Ukraine. Some----         U.S. officials have, nonetheless, expressed frustration at times over India's reluctance to more----         forcefully condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin.--------         "I think that, to date, there are certainly areas where we have been disappointed by both China and----         India's decisions in the context of the invasion in terms of their reaction overall," said Brian Deese, the----         director of the White House National Economic Council. "Our message to the Indian government is that----         the costs and consequences for them of moving into a more explicit strategic alignment with Russia will----         be significant and long-term."--------         India's skepticism of the U.S. grows more entrenched when American officials lecture India on Ukraine,----         Indian officials said.--------         "The Indian people have always sort of felt respected by the Russians and supported by the Russians,"----         said Ashley J. Tellis, an expert on Asian geopolitics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.----         "Whereas hectoring comes naturally to us" Americans.--------         Many current and former Indian officials can still rattle off moments in history where they felt that the----         U.S. wronged India: During the 1960s, President Lyndon B. Johnson personally reviewed monthly food----         aid shipments to India after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi criticized the American involvement in----         Vietnam. Then in 1971, the U.S. backed Pakistan in a war with India sparked by the Bangladeshi fight----         for independence. And in 1998, when the U.S. imposed sanctions on India for undertaking nuclear----         tests.--------         Recently, India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, has repeatedly brought up Afghanistan----         as an illustration of Western double-standards: The U.S. departure from Afghanistan was a huge blow----         to regional security for India, which views the Taliban as a proxy force for Pakistan and, by extension,----         China. And yet Europe didn't react to the fall of Afghanistan with the same outrage as to Ukraine, he----         said.--------         "What we saw in Afghanistan had a very, very strong impact certainly in India," he said during a panel----         discussion in late March with the British foreign minister. "It probably didn't have the same impact in----         Europe. People didn't relate to the coming of the Taliban in the same way."--------         Mr. Jaishankar sat on the panel just a few hours after the news briefing from Mr. Singh, the U.S. deputy----         national security adviser, in New Delhi. Indian officials said Mr. Jaishankar chose to respond by pointing----         out that Europe purchased 15% more Russian oil and gas in March compared with the month before.----         Only about 1% of India's oil imports come from Russia, he added. The Biden administration has echoed----         that point in recent weeks to minimize tensions between the two sides.--------         Share Your Thoughts--------         What steps should the U.S. take to encourage India to join its efforts to isolate Moscow? Join the----         discussion below.--------         U.S. officials said the intent of dispatching Mr. Singh, an architect of the administration's sanctions----         against Russia, to New Delhi was part of an effort to help allies understand the scope of the penalties----         imposed by the U.S. and European partners. "We don't want anyone to be caught off guard," one----         administration official said. "We want to talk about compliance with them."--------         Biden administration officials have been trying to convince their Indian counterparts that the U.S. will be----         a more reliable arms supplier in its cross-border confrontation with China. U.S. officials have argued----         that the Ukraine war shows that Russian military equipment is unreliable and that it will soon be in short----         supply because Russia will have to replenish its own stockpiles after using it on the battlefield in----         Ukraine. Western sanctions will prevent Russia from getting components for its advanced weapons----         systems, they say.--------         India has been diversifying its arms imports, buying more from France, Israel and the U.S. and boosting----         its domestic manufacturing of weapons and ammunition. During a visit to India on Friday, U.K. Prime----         Minister Boris Johnson promised to expedite arms exports to India and share expertise to help the----         country build its own equipment.--------         New Delhi is considering offers by the U.S. to supply more hardware and weapons, one Indian official----         said, but hasn't moved forward because of the high costs and reluctance of American companies to----         transfer technology. The discussions include potentially tapping into excess U.S. defense equipment----         and other financing plans to make purchasing U.S. arms more affordable to India, the State Department----         official said.--------         Top Biden officials also said they have yet to make a decision on whether India would be penalized----         over its purchase of a Russian missile-defense system, which would trigger automatic sanctions under----         a 2017 U.S. law, or if the administration would issue India a waiver.--------         In India's military, there are still grumblings against working too closely with the West. Moscow stepped----         in with defense equipment after the U.S. enforced a series of sanctions against India in the decades----         between 1965 and 2005.--------         D. S. Hooda, a retired lieutenant general who led India's northern command, said that a lot of India's----         military equipment could start running out of spare parts within months if Russia turns off the spigot,----         including tanks, long-range rockets, aircraft and air-defense systems. Russia has also supplied military----         equipment to India that other countries are unwilling to provide, such as leasing out a nuclear-powered----         attack submarine. "No other countries practically are going to provide that," he said.--------         Earlier this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged the complicated history between----         the U.S. and India and Russia, when he and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met their Indian----         counterparts.--------         "India's relationship with Russia developed over decades, at a time when the United States was not----         able to be a partner to India," said Mr. Blinken. "Times have changed. Today we are able and willing to----         be a partner of choice with India."--------         Write to Shan Li at shan.li@wsj.com, Rajesh Roy at rajesh.roy@wsj.com and Sabrina Siddiqui at----         Sabrina.Siddiqui@wsj.com--------         India's Neutrality on Ukraine Rooted in Deep Ties to Russia, Lingering Mistrust of U.S.--------NS       gdip : International Relations | gvdhs : Department of Homeland/National Security | gpir :----         Politics/International Relations | gvio : Military Action | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News |----         gcns : National/Public Security | gpol : Domestic Politics | grisk : Risk News | gvbod : Government----         Bodies | gvexe : Executive Branch | ncat : Content Types----RE       india : India | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | namz : North America |----         ndelh : New Delhi | uk : United Kingdom | ukrn : Ukraine | usa : United States | ussrz : CIS Countries |----         delhi : Delhi | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries |----         dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | indsubz : Indian Subcontinent |----         sasiaz : Southern Asia | weurz : Western Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      N/CMR--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220426ei4q001md------------------------CLM       World News----SE        World----HD        Russia Halting Gas Flows to Poland, Bulgaria Over Payment Terms; Poland was already aiming----          to become independent of Russian gas this year, but Bulgaria gets more than 75% of its gas----          from Russia----BY        By Drew Hinshaw and Georgi Kantchev----WC        932 words----PD        27 April 2022----ET        02:43----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          Russia said it would halt gas flows to Poland and Bulgaria starting Wednesday, the first time it has----          followed through on a threat to cut off countries that don't pay for their gas on new, wartime terms----          outlined in March by Russian President Vladimir Putin.--------          The move marks a major escalation by Russia, which has tried to bolster its currency by insisting----          customers pay for gas in rubles, and introduces the possibility that more economies in Europe, deeply----          dependent on Russian gas, could be targeted. Gas prices in Europe rose by more than 10% late----          Tuesday as traders weighed risks to already tight supplies.--------TD----          Poland and Bulgaria described receiving letters Tuesday from the Russian state-owned natural gas----          company Gazprom PJSC. Gazprom told Poland it would no longer send it gas via the 2,500 mile----          Yamal pipeline, according to Poland's state-controlled oil-and-gas company PGNiG, which received----          the letter. Poland "is obliged to pay for gas supplies in accordance with the new payment procedure,"----          Gazprom said, according to Russian state newswire TASS.--------          Late Tuesday, Bulgaria's energy ministry said its state-owned gas company Bulgargaz had received a----          letter from Gazprom stating that gas deliveries will cease from Wednesday. Bulgaria has already fully----          fulfilled its obligations under its contract with Gazprom, the Energy Ministry said. As in Poland, the----          issue appeared to be a new demand from Russia that European countries pay for their gas in rubles.----          No other European governments announced being given such a letter.--------          The decision will have little effect on Poland, which was already set to become independent of Russian----          gas by the end of this year. It is a much bigger deal for Bulgaria, which gets more than 75% of its gas----          from Russia and has few immediate options to fully replace it.--------          The action sets a worrisome precedent for the broader Europe Union, which before the war in Ukraine----          sourced as much as 40% of its gas from Russia. That gas heats European homes and powers----          factories, especially in Germany and Austria, which source more than half of their supplies from----          Moscow.--------          Russia's move "represents a substantial escalation," said Simone Tagliapietra, senior fellow at think----          tank Bruegel, who anticipated other governments could be hit next. "European governments now need----          to deploy all emergency measures they have at their disposal."--------          European countries such as Germany might need to resort to rationing and closing factories if Russian----          gas deliveries are cut off, other energy analysts have said. Germany would enter a sharp recession if----          Russian natural-gas deliveries are cut off, the country's leading economic think tanks said in a report----          earlier in April.--------          Last month, Mr. Putin signed a decree outlining a plan under which countries deemed hostile to----          Moscow, which includes European Union members, would have to pay in rubles. Customers can open--------          accounts at Gazprombank, a Russian lender, where they would pay in euros or dollars and the----          Russian lender would then buy rubles to pay for their deliveries.--------          Those measures would help Russia shore up its currency and keep its heavily sanctioned economy----          afloat.--------          But European countries have broadly denounced the demand, and have stuck to their previous----          method of paying for gas they get from Russia. Gas contracts are usually denominated in dollars or----          euros.--------          "There will be no shortage of gas in Polish homes," said the Polish Climate and Environment Minister----          Anna Moskwa. "We have been effectively independent from Russia for years."--------          The pipeline feeding Poland, the Yamal pipeline, flows from the near Arctic gas fields of northern----          Russia, south into Poland and then to Germany. The stoppage wouldn't have a big effect on Germany,----          which gets most of its Russian gas via another pipeline and has received little gas via Yamal in recent----          months.--------          Following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Berlin has been racing to reduce its dependency on Russian----          gas. The government of chancellor Olaf Scholz is trying to reduce this dependence by accelerating----          investments in renewable energy and building liquefied natural-gas terminals but has so far rejected an----          outright Russian gas embargo amid fears of the economic consequences.--------          A spokeswoman for the German economy ministry said that the security of supply in Germany is----          currently guaranteed. "We are monitoring the situation closely," the spokeswoman said.--------          Earlier in April the German government temporarily took control of a local Gazprom unit in a bid to----          make sure gas would keep flowing. Europe's biggest countries are betting that Russia won't cut them----          off, because it isn't easy to reroute huge quantities of natural gas and sell it in other markets.--------          The cancellation of gas supplies appears to be an effort by Moscow to pressure Sofia into not sending----          military support to Ukraine, said Dimitar Abadjiev, who focused on Bulgarian energy security as----          ambassador to Saudi Arabia, a post he recently left. Bulgaria is a major producer of non-NATO----          standard weapons and ammunition sought by Kyiv and lawmakers there are due to vote on supplying----          Ukraine next week, he said.--------          "It will be difficult," Mr. Abadjiev said of coping without Russian gas.--------          Natalia Ojewska and Joe Wallace contributed to this article.--------          Write to Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.com and Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com--------          Russia Halting Gas Flows to Poland, Bulgaria Over Payment Terms--------CO        gzprm : Gazprom PJSC | pgng : Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA--------IN        i1 : Energy | i13 : Crude Oil/Natural Gas Upstream Operations | ifosfl : Fossil Fuels | iioil : Integrated----          Oil/Gas----NS        ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | gvbod : Government Bodies | ncolu : Columns | gcat :----          Political/General News | gpir : Politics/International Relations | gpol : Domestic Politics | ncat : Content----          Types----RE        russ : Russia | pol : Poland | asiaz : Asia | bul : Bulgaria | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eecz : European----          Union Countries | eurz : Europe | gfr : Germany | uk : United Kingdom | ukrn : Ukraine | ussrz : CIS----          Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | balkz : Balkan States | bric : BRICS Countries | dach : DACH----          Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----          Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD       Wires--------IPC       BGAS.YY--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220426ei4q0063h------------------------CLM      Oil Markets----SE       Markets----HD       Russia Tried to Sell a Huge Slug of Oil.

Many expect Europe eventually to----         adopt a phased outright ban on bringing in Russian oil–an embargo promoted by newly re-elected----         French President Emmanuel Macron but resisted by Germany and Hungary, among other members.--------         But sanctions already in place, laid out by the EU in mid-March, and replicated by Switzerland, will ban----         companies from reselling Rosneft oil outside of Europe. This includes sales into the big Asian market,----         especially India, which has soaked up some of the Russian oil demand since Moscow invaded Ukraine.--------         Traders will still be able to bring Rosneft crude and refined products into the EU and Switzerland, which----         were exempted in order not to worsen a shortage of diesel and other fuels. But many companies in----         Europe are rapidly finding non-Russian sources of oil. The sanctions also target Transneft, the----         sprawling state pipeline system that carries oil to ports, creating an additional hurdle to handling----         Russian fuel.--------         If Rosneft keeps struggling to sell, it would represent a further shock for an economy already locked out----         of much of Western finance and commerce. The company says it is Russia's biggest taxpayer,----         contributing a fifth of budget revenue. In total, Russia's oil and gas sales made up 45% of the federal----         budget in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency.--------         "If they can't sell, they'll have to start shutting down," said Adi Imsirovic, senior research fellow at the----         Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and former head of oil trading at a subsidiary of Gazprom PJSC.--------------------         Rosneft, run by longtime Putin ally Igor Sechin, last week invited bids for about 5.1 million metric tons----         of Urals—or about 38 million barrels, enough to fill 19 large tankers—according to the traders and----         document. It asked for payment in rubles, an unusual twist, and said the oil would be loaded onto----         tankers at ports in the Baltic and Black Seas in May and June. Smaller volumes of other kinds of----         crude—including Siberian Light, Espo and Sokol—were also on offer.--------         Reuters earlier reported about Rosneft's inability to sell the oil.--------         Rosneft focuses on drilling for oil and gas, and refining crude into usable fuels. It has long outsourced----         most of the actual selling of the stuff to a handful of traders including Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd., Vitol----         and Glencore PLC, which in turn shipped the oil to buyers around the world.--------         The traders are however retreating from the Russian market before the EU sanctions kick in. Vitol, the----         world's biggest independent oil trader and which has a three-decade presence in Moscow, expects to----         stop trading Russian oil by the end of the year, people familiar with the decision said.--------         Rosneft's tender was an attempt to export crude that trading companies were no longer willing to----         handle, people familiar with the sale said.--------         Unlike the U.S., Russia doesn't have much space to store oil, so dwindling demand quickly backs up----         through the supply chain and prompts producers to throttle back output. Once wells are turned off, they----         can be hard to turn back on to their previous capacity.--------         Production has already fallen since the Feb. 24 invasion, although the scale of the losses is hard to----         gauge because Moscow is limiting the release of data on a swath of sectors. Rosneft and smaller----         private producers will encounter longer-term problems stemming from sanctions on sales of Western----         parts and technology to Russia, analysts said.--------         In a sign that refiners outside Russia are hunting for alternative suppliers, the country's flagship Urals----         grade of crude is trading at roughly $35 a barrel below the price of international benchmark Brent, said----         Tamas Varga, an analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates. Before the war, the two kinds of crude----         traded within a few dollars of each other.--------         Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com--------         Russia Tried to Sell a Huge Slug of Oil.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          BERLIN—The German government has decided to break a longstanding taboo on allowing the export----          of heavy weapons to Ukraine, yielding to mounting domestic and international pressure on Berlin to----          help boost Kyiv's defenses against Russia's aggression.--------          Antiaircraft cannon tanks known as Flakpanzer Gepard, or Cheetah, that have been decommissioned----          by the German armed forces will now be refurbished and sent to Ukraine, Defense Minister Christine----          Lambrecht said Tuesday.--------TD----          Germany will provide about 50 of the German-made self-propelled guns in what will mark a major----          delivery of non-Soviet weapons systems by a Western country to Ukraine, two government officials----          said.--------          Boosting Western assistance to Ukraine was important because Russian President Vladimir Putin's----          invasion has led Russia to depart from the community of civilized nations, Ms. Lambrecht said.--------          The move marks a U-turn by the government of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has been under----          pressure to send heavy weapons to Ukraine to help its armed forces fend off a renewed Russian----          offensive.--------          Mr. Scholz had resisted authorizing the delivery of heavy or offensive weapons to Ukraine, which he----          said on Friday could trigger a nuclear war with Russia.--------          While several European allies have pledged to send Soviet-era armored vehicles to Ukraine, this----          would be one of the first examples of a country providing Western-made equipment.--------          Ms. Lambrecht announced the decision at a meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense----          ministers on Tuesday. The meeting, which was convened by the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd----          Austin, took place at the Ramstein U.S. Air Force base in Germany.--------          The Gepard self-propelled antiaircraft cannons were removed from service more than a decade ago----          and are now stored by their manufacturer, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann GmbH, a German company----          military experts say makes some of the most advanced tanks in the world.--------          Ukraine approached KMW and other leading German arms manufacturers and requested contracts for----          heavy hardware such as tanks and antiaircraft systems. Most of these orders would be paid for by----          Ukraine, which receives large funds from NATO allies to boost its defenses. In the case of the Gepard----          systems, Germany will pay for the whole deal, Ms. Lambrecht said.--------          The government will allow the company to export the weapons to Ukraine, the officials said.--------          KMW was in talks with Ukraine about the transaction before the war broke out and has long awaited----          export permission from the government in Berlin, according to people familiar with the negotiations.------------          "Our tanks are in good shape, and they can be delivered very, very quickly," a KMW spokesman said.--------          As of Tuesday, the company, which also offers training and maintenance for its products, hadn't yet----          received any export approval from the government, said the spokesman. Such a procedure could be----          initiated swiftly and the company had completed similar contracts for the same weapons recently,----          including with Qatar, the spokesman said.--------          Other leading German arms manufacturers have also sought permission from the government to send----          heavy weapons, including different types of tanks and artillery, to Ukraine, according to people familiar----          with the discussions. Export permissions for these haven't been granted.--------          Earlier in the conflict, German ministers approved the supply of smaller arms to Ukraine, such as----          hand-held antitank and antiaircraft missiles.--------          Berlin also agreed to supply German-made tanks and other weapons systems to NATO nations that----          had formerly been aligned with Moscow and still have Soviet hardware that Ukrainian troops are able----          to easily integrate into their arsenal. Mr. Scholz said last week that one such deal was made with----          Slovenia, a tiny central European country, which has about 40 tanks based on the Soviet-era T-72----          main battle tanks.--------          "The Gepard is a very efficient system…but it is also one of the most complex ones, with two radar----          devices," said Gustav Gressel, a military expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations.--------          This complexity means providing training and maintenance logistics to enable the Ukrainians to----          effectively use the Gepards would take longer, but they would ultimately be very useful in what is----          shaping up to be a prolonged conflict, Mr. Gressel said.--------          In addition, he said, the decision to allow the export of the Gepards could pave the way for further----          transfers of German heavy arms to Ukraine because it does away with Berlin's previous objections.--------          Tuesday's decision caps weeks of at-times contradictory statements by members of Mr. Scholz's----          government over what type of military aid Germany could and should offer Ukraine. While Mr. Scholz----          and his center-left Social Democrats have been the most reluctant to help, other parties in his----          coalition, especially the Green foreign and economy ministers, repeatedly struck a more aggressive----          tone, calling for swift arms deliveries to the country.--------          Despite Germany's participation in armed operations in Afghanistan, Africa and elsewhere, the Social----          Democrats have a long tradition of pacifism and maintaining friendly relations with Russia.--------          Initially, Mr. Scholz and Ms. Lambrecht claimed that Germany was banned by law from delivering arms----          into a conflict zone. Other officials invoked moral qualms about German weapons being used against----          Russia in light of the Nazi atrocities in the Soviet Union during World War II.--------          Days into the conflict, Berlin performed a first U-turn by agreeing to send Ukraine several shipments of----          small arms and ammunition as well as a limited number of armored personnel carriers. Ms. Lambrecht----          and Mr. Scholz said at the time that such shipments had exhausted Germany's potential to provide----          any further military aid to Ukraine.--------          Following revelations about alleged war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine and amid pressure----          from the Greens and the Free Democratic Party, the chancellor and defense ministers first reiterated----          their opposition to heavy-weapons shipments. Operating such sophisticated systems would require----          extensive training, they argued, limiting their immediate usefulness to Ukraine.--------          On Friday, Mr. Scholz invoked a new argument, telling the German weekly Der Spiegel that escalating----          military aid could trigger an aggressive reaction from Russia that might spiral into World War III.--------          Mr. Scholz's continued resistance threatened to destabilize the coalition after the opposition----          Conservatives said they would request a parliamentary vote in favor of sending heavy weapons to----          Ukraine—an initiative some coalition members hinted they might support.--------          Various polls conducted since the start of the war have shown that a majority of Germans favored----          sending heavy military hardware to Ukraine. On Saturday, however, an INSA survey showed this----          support weakening, with 50% of respondents saying they were against deliveries and 43% in favor.--------          Write to Bojan Pancevski at bojan.pancevski@wsj.com--------          Germany to Send Heavy Weapons to Ukraine Following Allied Pressure----------------CO        fgvger : Federal Government of Germany--------IN        idef : Defense Equipment/Products | iaer : Aerospace/Defense | iindstrls : Industrial Goods--------NS        gweap : Weapons Programs | gcat : Political/General News | gvexe : Executive Branch | gdip :----          International Relations | gvdef : Defense Department | gpir : Politics/International Relations | gpol :----          Domestic Politics | gvbod : Government Bodies | gvio : Military Action | ncolu : Columns | gcns :----          National/Public Security | gdef : Armed Forces | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content Types----RE        ukrn : Ukraine | gfr : Germany | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eecz : European Union Countries |----          eurz : Europe | russ : Russia | uk : United Kingdom | ussrz : CIS Countries | weurz : Western Europe |----          apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | dach : DACH Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----          Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe----IPD       Wires--------IPC       032500.KQ--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220426ei4q000xd------------------------CLM      World News----SE       World----HD       Lawmakers Prepare to Tackle More Aid for Ukraine in Shift to Long-Term Support; An expected----         Biden administration economic and military aid request has bipartisan backing----BY       By Natalie Andrews, Andrew Duehren and William Mauldin----WC       1,005 words----PD       27 April 2022----ET       05:01----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         WASHINGTON—Lawmakers said they were prepared to quickly approve another package funding----         weapons and economic aid for Ukraine, as the U.S. shifted to a longer-term commitment to back Kyiv----         to fend off Russia's invasion.--------         Earlier this year, Congress approved $13.6 billion in military, humanitarian and economic aid to----         Ukraine as part of a broader spending bill. With the war continuing to rage, the White House is----         expected to send a supplemental request to Congress for a second multibillion-dollar aid package by----         the end of the week, aides and lawmakers said.--------TD----         "We're just waiting for the administration to state that number," said Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.).--------         Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) called the conflict a war between "tyranny vs.----         democracy itself" and said the U.S. "has a moral obligation to help the Ukrainian people with the tools----         they need, for as long as they need them." He didn't provide timing or details on any vote.--------         Republicans said they also were on board but wanted Democratic leaders to keep the Ukraine----         spending package separate from other pending agenda items, such as a stalled package funding----         Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, which has been caught up in a dispute over border policy.--------         "I'm concerned that Chuck Schumer and [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi will try to politicize this by----         combining it with something that may not be attractive for Republicans, then somehow blame----         Republicans that they don't support aid for Ukraine," said Sen. Steve Daines (R., Mont.).--------         "The key is more, more of everything," said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), adding the U.S. should----         send "whatever they need in terms of economic assistance and military assistance."--------         On nonmilitary aid, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko said in an interview with The Wall----         Street Journal that he was seeking $2 billion a month in U.S. economic support to cover the next three----         months. The Biden administration has previously released $1 billion in funds to help Ukraine pay for----         basic government services and public employees' salaries.--------         "We want this bridge to the new normal, we are not seeking how to cover all expenses to the end of the----         year," he said.--------         Lawmakers returned this week after a two-week recess from Washington with a renewed focus to help----         the embattled country, which Russia invaded in February. Many have visited the Ukrainian-Polish----         border, and Mr. Daines went to see the killings of Ukrainians in Bucha, the town outside Kyiv----         previously occupied by Russian forces.--------         The U.S. has supplied Ukraine with billions of dollars in munitions and lethal aid, including hundreds of----         Stinger antiaircraft weapons and thousands of Javelin antiarmor systems, and along with allies----         imposed punishing sanctions on Russia.------------         In recent days, the administration has emphasized that weapons and aid provided to Ukraine are being----         put to good use in a fight that is also paying dividends to Kyiv and the North Atlantic Treaty----         Organization in terms of a weaker Russian military.--------         Emergency spending bills such as a new Ukraine package often are funded through deficit spending.----         No lawmakers on Tuesday cited a need to find offsets or new revenue to pay for the new aid.--------         As part of their trip to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, Secretary of State Antony----         Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stopped by a facility in southeast Poland that was in the----         process of distributing 155mm howitzers, artillery rounds and other weapons and supplies bound for----         nearby Ukraine.--------         "For every plane that the Russians have flown in the skies, there have been about 10 antiaircraft----         munitions of one kind or another," said Mr. Blinken in testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations----         Committee on Tuesday.--------         Now that Ukraine has beaten back the Russian advance on its northern cities and stopped President----         Vladimir Putin's attempt to topple its leadership, the U.S. and its partners want to redouble efforts to----         supply long-range weapons needed for the current phase of the conflict in the country's east and south.--------         The Biden administration is seeking to strike a careful balance between making sure Ukraine has what----         it needs to fight Russia—which also hurts Moscow's ability to threaten its neighbors in the future—and----         avoiding steps perceived as escalating the conflict or drawing NATO countries into the war.--------         "NATO is, in essence, going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy," Russian----         Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in a Russian state-TV interview broadcast Monday night. "Under----         no circumstances should a third world war be allowed to happen," he said, adding that "there can be----         no winners in a nuclear war."--------         Mr. Austin, speaking to reporters at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Tuesday, said "any bluster----         about the possible use of nuclear weapons is dangerous and unhelpful."--------         A day earlier, he told reporters in Poland that "we want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it----         can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine."--------         The approval of new aid could be slowed down if Democratic leadership tries to tie the Ukraine funding----         to Covid aid. Senators had a deal on a $10 billion Covid deal involving repurposing of existing funds,----         but a vote was delayed after Republicans insisted on amending the bill to extend a pandemic-era----         immigration policy called Title 42—which allows Border Patrol agents to quickly turn away migrants at----         the southern border. Some Democrats have sided with Republicans in calling for a vote on Title 42.--------         Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com, Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com----         and William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com--------         Lawmakers Prepare to Tackle More Aid for Ukraine in Shift to Long-Term Support--------NS       gcat : Political/General News | gpol : Domestic Politics | gpir : Politics/International Relations | gvio :----         Military Action | ncolu : Columns | gcns : National/Public Security | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content----         Types----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | usa : United States | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe |----         namz : North America | uk : United Kingdom | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS----         Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----         Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD      WSJ--------IPC      N/GEN--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220426ei4q006sh------------------------CLM       Markets Main----SE        Markets----HD        HSBC's Quarterly Profit Drops 28%; Bank hit by provisions for souring loans in Russia and----          China, but says it is benefiting from rising interest rates----BY        By Quentin Webb and Julie Steinberg----WC        842 words----PD        26 April 2022----ET        16:05----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

While earnings had been boosted a year earlier by the release of $435 million of----          provisions as the global economy recovered from the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, in the first three----          months of this year HSBC's earnings were dented by $642 million of new expected credit losses.--------TD----          The new expected losses included about $250 million tied to Russian borrowers, and some $160----          million linked to China's property sector—against which it had also taken charges in the previous----          quarter. Still, HSBC's profit rose on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and beat analysts' consensus----          forecasts, as the credit-loss charges came in below expectations.--------          Revenue fell 4% from a year ago to $12.5 billion, undershooting expectations. The bank said this----          figure was reduced by $342 million of "market impacts" in life insurance, as weak stock markets----          reduced the value of that business's share portfolio. HSBC said stringent Covid-19 restrictions and----          temporary branch closures in Hong Kong also weighed on its revenue for the quarter.--------          Chief Executive Noel Quinn said lending volumes were up across the bank, while its personal banking,----          insurance and trade finance businesses were showing good growth. "I'm encouraged by our start to----          the year," he said in a statement.--------          Mr. Quinn said despite economic uncertainty, rising interest rates had made the bank more confident----          of being able to generate a 10%-plus return on tangible equity next year.--------          Lenders like HSBC can earn higher profit margins on loans when interest rates are higher. In recent----          months government bond yields and interbank lending rates have surged, as the U.S. Federal----          Reserve and other central banks have begun tightening monetary policy to combat rapid inflation.--------          Government bond prices have tumbled this year, pushing yields up sharply. The yield on the----          benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note stood at 2.825% Monday, up 1.329 percentage point so far this----          year.--------          At the same time, however, the bond-market selloff has dealt a short-term setback to HSBC's capital----          ratios, since it holds a big portfolio of government and corporate debt as a partial hedge against lower----          interest rates. The bank recorded fair value losses, before tax, of about $4.9 billion so far this year----          through April 19, on the holdings.--------          After unveiling $3 billion of stock buybacks in its last two sets of results, HSBC said it was unlikely to----          introduce new repurchases in 2022, given pressure on its capital position. The bank said its core----          equity tier 1 ratio could fall below its targeted minimum of 14%, due to volatility in its hedging portfolio.------------          It warned that the planned sale of its French retail business, agreed last year, would also cut the ratio----          by 0.35 percentage point.--------          HSBC's Hong Kong-listed stock fell 4.2% Tuesday to 49.50 Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to $6.31 per----          share, underperforming a broader market that was slightly higher.--------          Even after Tuesday's fall, HSBC's stock has gained about 5.5% so far this year, beating broader----          market benchmarks. Hong Kong's flagship Hang Seng Index has declined nearly 15%.--------          In the past week, an anonymous HSBC shareholder has called for the bank to look at unlocking the----          value of its Asian operations, saying it should examine options such as a potential spinoff that could----          break the bank into two businesses focused on Asia and elsewhere.--------          The investor has hired a public-relations firm to help publicize its demands. It says the bank's----          management has failed to implement its strategy, particularly on costs, and investors are souring on----          the global banking model due to political risk.--------          HSBC said Tuesday it was on track to hold adjusted operating expenses for 2022 in line with last----          year's figures, despite inflationary pressures, and said it expected to cut more than $2 billion of costs----          this year.--------          Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson batted away the shareholder's suggestion to split up HSBC.----          That fundamentally undermines the strategy of the bank, which is based on global connectivity, he----          said. "That's the essence of the entire business model."--------          Mr. Stevenson added that the bank's strategy is the right one and is reflected by its share price. HSBC----          hasn't had any contact with the shareholder and doesn't know its identity, he said.--------          Write to Quentin Webb at quentin.webb@wsj.com and Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com--------          HSBC's Quarterly Profit Drops 28%--------CO        hksbc : HSBC Holdings PLC--------IN        i81402 : Commercial Banking | i814 : Banking | ifinal : Financial Services | ibnk : Banking/Credit | iibnk----          : Integrated Banks----NS        e1202 : Interest Rates | c151 : Earnings | gsars : Novel Coronaviruses | gout : Outbreaks/Epidemics |----          e12 : Monetary Policy | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | ecat : Economic News | ghea : Health | ncolu----          : Columns | gcat : Political/General News | c15 : Financial Performance | gcold : Respiratory Tract----          Diseases | gmed : Medical Conditions | gspox : Infectious Diseases | ncat : Content Types | nfact :----          Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter----RE        china : China | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | hkong : Hong Kong |----          ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | chinaz : Greater China | devgcoz----          : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe----IPD       WSJ--------IPC       0005.HK--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220426ei4q000gp------------------------CLM      World News----SE       World----HD       Ukraine Refugees: What to Know About the Humanitarian Situation; Speed, scale of exodus----         from Ukraine outstrip any movement of people since World War II----BY       By Joanna Sugden----WC       1,215 words----PD       27 April 2022----ET       02:09----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         More than 5.2 million people—many of them children—have fled the war in Ukraine in just over two----         months since Russian President Vladimir Putinbegan his onslaught on the country on Feb. 24,----         according to the U.N.'s refugee agency, which now expects more than eight million people to be forced----         from the country by the war.--------TD----         The exodus, which was already the largest movement of people in Europe since World War II, now----         means more than one in 10 people have left Ukraine since the outbreak of war and over one quarter of----         the population have been forced from their homes. The U.N. refugee agency had previously estimated----         four million people could be driven from the country as a result of Russia's invasion but updated the----         prediction on April 26 to 8.3 million, which equates to more than one in six of the prewar population.--------         The refugee crisis triggered by the war has flooded border crossings, trains and bus stations in----         neighboring countries with refugees—mostly women and children—seeking safety. Most are going to----         Poland, where more than 2.92 million had arrived by April 25, according to the U.N. High----         Commissioner for Refugees. Many have been welcomed with offers of places to stay and basic----         provisions, which they had to abandon before they left.--------         What is the latest on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine?--------         While the flow of refugees out of the country has slowed since March, Russia's new offensive in the----         eastern Donbas area has led to the evacuation of thousands of civilians from the region. A Russian----         missile strike on a train station that was serving as an evacuation hub in the region killed at least 52----         people and injured more than 100.--------         Hundreds of people were killed in northern Ukrainian towns formerly occupied by Russian forces,----         prompting investigations into alleged war crimes. President Volodymyr Zelensky described Russian----         troops as "murderers" and "rapists" as the extent of killings in towns surrounding the Ukrainian capital----         began to emerge at the start of April. The discoveries sparked an outcry from Western leaders and----         added to pressure on the Biden administration and its European allies to take stronger action against----         Moscow.--------         Successive efforts to set up evacuation routes out of civilian areas in Ukrainian cities under Russian----         fire have collapsed.--------         Are peace talks helping?--------         Not much. Hopes for a breakthrough in peace talks dimmed toward the end of March after Moscow----         followed through on its advertised shift in war plans in Ukraine by redoubling its ground and air assaults----         in eastern portions of the country. Mr. Putin said peace talks with Kyiv had reached a dead end, as----         Moscow's forces on April 12 bombarded Ukrainian military positions and residential areas in the----         country's east and unleashed new rocket attacks.----------------         How many people have left Ukraine since the Russian invasion?--------         Some 5,264,767 people have fled Ukraine since Feb. 24, according to the UNHCR, as of April 25,----         more than 90% of them women and children.--------         More than seven million people have also been internally displaced by the fighting, many of them----         children, according to UNHCR, which says another 13 million people are trapped in places affected by----         the war, unable to escape.--------         The UNHCR at the outset of the war predicted that four million people in total could be made refugees----         by the invasion. That figure was exceeded within five weeks of the outbreak of invasion and was----         updated to 8.3 million by April 26.--------         Most of the refugees are women and children because of a law in Ukraine that prevents most men of----         fighting age from leaving the country.--------         Where are refugees going?--------         About 2.92 million people have entered neighboring Poland, which shares a 330-mile border with----         Ukraine.--------         Romania has accepted more than 780,000 refugees, while Hungary and Moldova have each taken in----         more than 430,000. About 614,0000 people have left Ukraine for Russia, according to the UNHCR.--------         Have any returned to Ukraine?--------         Yes. On April 17, more people entered Ukraine from Poland than went in the other way, according to----         Poland's Border Guard, the first time since Russia's invasion that the number crossing the Polish----         border into Ukraine has exceeded those fleeing in the other direction. The Ukrainian Border Guard said----         on April 19 that more than one million Ukrainians had entered the country since the start of the war. By----         April 26, some 1.86 million people had entered Ukraine since the conflict started, but the figure includes----         those going back and forth, according to the UNHCR.--------         Is the U.S. taking refugees from Ukraine?--------         Yes. The Biden administration is asking U.S. citizens, businesses and nonprofit groups to sponsor----         Ukrainian refugees for temporary humanitarian protections in the U.S.--------         The new refugee sponsorship program, which started April 25, will become the main path the----         administration hopes to use to fulfill its promise of taking in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees who have left----         their country after Russia's invasion.--------         How have refugees been received in host countries?--------         In general, they have been welcomed. "We do not call them 'refugees'" said Polish President Andrzej----         Duda on March 25 at a meeting with President Biden. "They are our guests, our brothers, our----         neighbors from Ukraine who today are in a very difficult situation," he added.--------         The EU has offered those escaping the war a visa waiver to live and work in any member state for up----         to three years.--------         Poland set up reception centers along its border with Ukraine for refugees to receive meals, rest and----         medical help.--------         What does the influx of refugees mean for the region?--------         During the height of the Syrian war in 2015-16, countries such as Poland and Hungary drew ire from----         some European leaders by opposing migrant quotas from the EU and putting up fences and other----         restrictions aimed at keeping people out. Those countries are again at the border of another----         humanitarian crisis and giving refuge to residents of a post-Soviet neighbor that has long voiced----         aspirations to become an EU member.--------         Basic services in Poland are buckling under that avalanche of refugees from the Russian invasion of----         Ukraine. In Warsaw, the local government is registering so many new Ukrainian arrivals that the city's----         computer system crashed. In Krakow, housing is in such short supply that refugees are being sent to----         lodging as much as 5½ hours away. And officials in both cities are now begging other countries to take----         in more people fleeing Ukraine. "Help us out. Help us out. You need to accept as many people as you----         can," said Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski.------------         What is a refugee?--------         Refugees are people who have fled war, violence, conflict or persecution and have crossed an----         international border to find safety in another country, according to the UNHCR.--------         —Bojan Pancevski, James Marson, Drew Hinshaw, Ian Lovett and Michelle Hackman contributed to----         this article.--------         This article may be updated.--------         Write to Joanna Sugden at joanna.sugden@wsj.com--------         Ukraine Refugees: What to Know About the Humanitarian Situation--------CO       unhcr : United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees--------NS       gimm : Human Migration | gvexe : Executive Branch | gvio : Military Action | gpir : Politics/International----         Relations | gpol : Domestic Politics | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News | gcns :----         National/Public Security | grisk : Risk News | gvbod : Government Bodies | ncat : Content Types----RE       russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | namz : North----         America | uk : United Kingdom | usa : United States | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric :----         BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----         Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      N/DJN--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220418ei4i001gt------------------------CLM     Russia News----SE      World----HD      Who Are Russia's Oligarchs and Why Are They Under Scrutiny? Roman Abramovich, who was----        sanctioned by the U.K., has moved to sell a trophy asset, the Chelsea FC soccer club----BY      By Chip Cummins----WC      1,015 words----PD      26 April 2022----ET      23:35----SN      The Wall Street Journal Online----SC      WSJO----LA      English----CY      Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----        In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S., the European Union, the U.K., Australia and----        others have said they are moving to scrutinize the assets of a handful of rich and powerful Russians.----        See a WSJ graphic here describing who they are and how they orbit Russian President Vladimir Putin.--------TD----        Governments have targeted these so-called oligarchs with sanctions and asset freezes. They have also----        gone after Putin friends and family, such as his two daughters. The sanctions lists aren't identical. The----        EU and U.K., for instance, have sanctioned Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of British soccer----        team Chelsea FC. Washington, though, has held off because of his role in peace talks between Ukraine----        and Russia.--------        What's happening to Roman Abramovich?--------        Mr. Abramovich has become the highest-profile member of the oligarch class in recent weeks. The U.K.----        and the Channel island of Jersey have frozen about $20 billion in assets the two governments say they----        suspect is linked to Mr. Abramovich.--------        He made his fortune in the oil business during Russia's lurch from communism to capitalism. He then----        embarked on a lavish spending spree around the world, snapping up Chelsea, expensive real estate in----        the U.K. and the U.S., yachts, planes and a formidable art collection. He has also donated generously to----        charities. More recently, he has emerged as a public face in negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.----        His peacemaking role was brokered by a Ukrainian film producer, who knew both Mr. Abramovich and----        Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Abramovich has also triggered controversy in Portugal.----        His receipt of a Portuguese passport has ratcheted up scrutiny of a program there that grants citizenship----        to descendants of Jews expelled five centuries ago during the Inquisition.--------        What is an oligarch?--------        The term comes from political science. An oligarchy describes a power system led by a small group of----        people. In recent years, the word "oligarch" has taken on a more specific meaning when it relates to----        Russia, referring to the group of Russian businesspeople and officials who gained wealth and power in----        the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union.--------        Why are Western governments imposing sanctions on Russian oligarchs?--------        The U.S. has sanctioned many of these individuals in years past, including after Russia's 2014----        annexation of Crimea. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the U.S., EU and U.K. have intensified restrictions----        and added names to their target lists.--------        The Biden administration has said the oligarchs provide resources to support Mr. Putin's Ukraine military----        campaign and must pay the price. Mr. Putin is "looking at the impact on his own economy, on his rich----        and wealthy oligarch friends, and on the people of Russia," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said----        in February about the U.S. and allied sanction effort.------------        How do sanctions against individuals work?--------        Governments have powers to temporarily freeze assets of individuals or entities in their jurisdiction,----        without proving criminality. Owners of assets are typically barred from selling or benefiting from them----        until sanctions are lifted or successfully contested. Governments typically can't move to take ownership----        of the assets, though, except after often-lengthy legal proceedings that would require proof of----        lawbreaking. The U.K. government, however, is considering laws that would give itself the powers to----        seize sanctioned assets.--------        How did Russia's oligarchs gain their wealth and power?--------        The country's current crop of billionaires and officials accumulated wealth and power in different ways.----        Some of those on the sanction list are part of Mr. Putin's inner circle; others are longtime associates; still----        others benefited from a wave of privatizations that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.--------        Do they all have yachts?--------        No, but like many superhigh-net-worth individuals, many do. Those vessels have become high-profile,----        hard-to-hide targets for authorities. French officials, for instance, seized one that it says belongs to a----        company majority owned by Igor Sechin, the sanctioned chief executive of Russian oil producer Rosneft.----        The 280-foot yacht, the Amore Vero, was seized at a shipyard in La Ciotat, on France's Mediterranean----        coast. The yacht was undergoing repairs, but French authorities said arrangements were being made----        for it to sail urgently. Mr. Sechin is sanctioned by the U.S. and the EU. When he was sanctioned in 2014----        by the U.S., he said he considered the move an endorsement of his effectiveness at Rosneft.--------        What other expensive toys do they own?--------        They are well-known buyers of art, trophy real estate, sports teams and private jets. Here's a look at----        some of Russia's best-known oligarchs and some of their high-profile holdings. They were such big----        players in London's high-end real estate that some are bracing for disruption in that market.--------        What are some of them saying about the Russian attack on Ukraine?--------        Oleg Deripaska, a raw-materials magnate who was previously sanctioned in the U.S., wrote on social----        media that peace "is very important." Mr. Deripaska sued the Treasury Department in 2019 challenging----        his inclusion in an agency report on Russian oligarchs as well as the sanctions against him, alleging the----        U.S. made false accusations based on rumor and innuendo to support the sanctions.--------        Mikhail Fridman, a founder of Alfa Bank, Russia's largest private bank, was sanctioned by the EU. Mr.----        Fridman said that he would contest the designation and that he isn't politically or financially connected to----        Mr. Putin.--------        "It seems to me that we have done a lot of good things, invested in companies, created a lot of jobs,"----        Mr. Fridman said at a press conference from his private-equity firm's office in London. "We will litigate to----        protect our reputation."--------        This explanatory article may be updated periodically.--------        Who Are Russia's Oligarchs and Why Are They Under Scrutiny?--------CO      euruno : European Union--------NS      gvexe : Executive Branch | gesanc : International Sanctions | gcat : Political/General News | cactio :----        Corporate Actions | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | cdiv : Divestments | gpir : Politics/International----        Relations | gsocc : Soccer | gvbod : Government Bodies | ncolu : Columns | c18 : Ownership Changes |----        gdip : International Relations | gpol : Domestic Politics | gspo : Sports | ncat : Content Types | nfact :----        Factiva Filters | nfce : C&E Exclusion Filter | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter | nrgn : Routine General----        News----RE      russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | uk : United Kingdom |----        ussrz : CIS Countries | weurz : Western Europe | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz----        : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe----IPD     WSJ--------IPC     ALFA.UR--------PUB     Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN      Document WSJO000020220421ei4l000gp----------------SE       Daily----HD       Raytheon Expects Sales to Fall.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         Raytheon Technologies quarterly earnings beat estimates but the defense company cut its full year----         sales forecast on Tuesday citing sanctions on Russia.--------         Raytheon reiterated its full-year adjusted earnings forecast of $4.60 to $4.80-a-share. But revenue is----         estimated to be $67.75 billion to $68.75 billion, lower than the range of $68.5 billion to $69.5 billion----         given by the company in January. Analysts expect $4.79-per-share on $68.99 billion for 2022.--------TD----         For the first quarter, the company took a hit of almost $300 million in charges and adjustments or----         expenses related to Russia sanctions and about $80 million in sales did not materialize due to the----         impact.--------         On its website, Raytheon states that it has suspended operations in Russia and all sales and support----         services to Russia's civil aviation industry. In an earnings call with analysts, Raytheon confirmed that its----         not going back to the region and its joint venture in the region; a facility which built parts for aerospace----         companies Boeing and Embraer is closed.--------         Russia made up about 1.5% of total sales or about $900 million a year, the management said in the----         earnings call. "We're going to be able to offset that [hit] through cost reduction and just cost----         containment, but it is not a small number for us as we think about the guidance for the year," they----         added.--------         Russia was also a large source of some of the titanium and casting supplies for Raytheon, "and many----         of those are now on the sanctions list," the management said.--------         Despite the revised guidance and the supply impact, the company said in its press release that it's----         confident in the long-term outlook for its businesses, supported by the return to travel and growing----         global defense budgets.--------         Raytheon, who supplies aircraft communications, navigation and surveillance equipment through its----         Collins Aerospace unit, posted adjusted earnings of $1.15-a-share in the first quarter on revenue of----         $15.7 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected Raytheon to generate $1.01-a- share on revenue----         of $15.8 billion. A year earlier, Raytheon made $15.25 billion in revenue.--------         Besides Collins, Raytheon has three other units: aircraft engine manufacturer Pratt and Whitney,----         sensor solution provider Raytheon Intelligence and Space, and Raytheon Missiles and Defense, which----         produces precision weapons and radars.--------         The company said supply chain constraints and declines on certain Land Warfare and Air Defense----         programs impacted its Raytheon Missiles and Defense sales in the first quarter but higher commercial----         aftermarket sales at Pratt and Whitney and Collins more than offset lower military sales volume.--------         Robert Stallard of Vertical Research Partners who rates the stock as a Buy with a $123 price target,----         views the quarter as a mixed bag. He highlighted the strong adjusted profit margin of 12.1% at Collins,----------------         which was above the 7.6% reported in 2021 and his estimate. But "we wouldn't be expecting the stock----         to be moving too much either way on this set of numbers," he noted.--------         Raytheon Technologies (ticker: RTX) stock went up 0.1% to $99.74 on Tuesday on Tuesday. The stock----         is up 16% year-to-date.--------         Full year sales at Collins' and Pratt's will be $375 million lower than previously anticipated due to the----         sanctions.--------         Its competitor Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported first-quarter results last week; its earnings beat----         estimates but sales fell short of expectations. That group expects EPS of roughly $26.70 for the full----         year of 2022 on sales of about $66 billion. Analysts were looking for $26.42 per share on sales of----         $66.12 billion--------         Write to Karishma Vanjani at karishma.vanjani@dowjones.com--------         Raytheon Expects Sales to Fall.

Joe Manchin Pushes for Democratic Compromise on Climate Agenda; High energy prices----          and Russia's invasion of Ukraine give coal-state lawmaker leverage on measures to promote----          fossil fuels----BY        By Timothy Puko----WC        1,351 words----PD        26 April 2022----ET        19:24----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          WASHINGTON—Voter unrest over high energy prices and concern over dependence on Russian----          energy have given Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) leverage to press for measures promoting more----          domestic fossil-fuel production in the Democrats' new climate legislation and potential executive----          actions.--------          Mr. Manchin's interests include getting financial and permitting help for natural-gas exports and oil and----          gas pipelines, as well as policies to make it easier for companies to drill more on federal territory,----          according to lobbyists and congressional aides familiar with the situation.--------TD----          More Democrats, including President Biden, have tried to push the country away from fossil fuels in----          recent years to address climate change. But in a closely divided Senate, Democrats need Mr.----          Manchin's support for clean-energy initiatives they hope to revive. They were included in Mr. Biden's----          Build Back Better bill, which Mr. Manchin helped torpedo last year.--------          Polls showing voters are unhappy with inflation fed by high energy prices have put added pressure on----          Democrats. With expectations high that Republicans might be able to retake House or Senate----          majorities in this year's midterm elections, some Democrats might be open to a compromise benefiting----          the traditional energy industry to pass a climate bill while they still can.--------          "Basically this is going to be the Manchin bill," said Edward Hild, a former chief of staff to Sen. Lisa----          Murkowski (R., Alaska) who is now a lobbyist with the law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney.----          "Everybody knows."--------          Several moves for which Mr. Manchin has voiced support would likely need to come through the----          executive branch—not legislation—meaning Mr. Biden would need to sign orders and take actions on----          his own concurrently with the passage of a spending bill as part of any deal. Lobbyists and aides who----          have spoken to Mr. Manchin and his staff said they have yet to outline which measures he must have----          to vote for an energy and climate bill.--------          The new package being discussed would reshape climate-related elements of the failed Build Back----          Better legislation to include more measures aimed at helping Western nations wean themselves off----          energy products supplied by Russia and other authoritarian regimes, the people familiar with the----          situation said.--------          Supporters in Congress, including Mr. Manchin, have said such steps would strengthen energy----          security for the U.S. and its allies abroad. They would help Western countries with short-term----          measures aimed at increasing supplies of natural gas, gasoline and other fossil fuels, as well as----          long-range strategies to develop cleaner alternatives such as wind and solar power.--------          Pairing some domestic fossil-fuel development with clean-energy measures helps Congress address----          climate change and the energy vulnerabilities exposed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, said Joseph--------          Majkut, director of the energy-security and climate-change program at the Center for Strategic and----          International Studies.--------          "If this crisis worsens, energy security, economies and human welfare are all at risk," Mr. Majkut said.----          "In many ways, the things you do to answer one of these crises is also an answer to the other."--------          Aides to Mr. Manchin have explored legislation for federal funds to help European allies build new----          terminals to accept more U.S.-produced natural gas, one of the people said.--------          Another move his team has considered would give the energy secretary authority to fast-track the----          equivalent of free-trade status for North Atlantic Treaty Organization members and other U.S. allies----          who want to buy American natural gas but don't have free-trade agreements, this person said.--------          Some of Mr. Manchin's efforts are expected to face opposition from some Democrats who say the----          Biden administration has already retreated too far from its goal of weaning the U.S. off fossil fuels.--------          Asked for comment, the White House responded with a series of recent statements from----          administration officials, including comments from principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre----          saying the administration is seeking to increase short-term supplies of gasoline while still pressing----          forward with the transition to clean energy.--------          "Addressing the emergency supply crunch while accelerating clean energy efforts is fully consistent----          with the theory of the case and what we're trying to do," she said.--------          Climate activists are expecting to compromise, said Justin Guay, director for global climate strategy at----          the Sunrise Project, an environmental group. But they will likely draw the line at gas-export terminals----          and other big infrastructure that could encourage years of additional fossil-fuel consumption.--------          "A climate bill can't be a cover for cynical opportunism and handouts for fossil fuels," he said.--------          Democrats could strike a deal that fulfills some of Mr. Manchin's demands, even help for pipelines, and----          still make the progress they need if the clean-energy provisions are strong enough, according to----          Rhodium Group, an independent research firm.--------          "One pipeline is not going to make or break whether we solve climate change," said John Larsen, who----          leads the firm's U.S. energy-system and climate-policy research. "The clean-energy investments----          should be a much bigger deal, a much bigger benefit than any small cost on the supply side."--------          Mr. Manchin, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has long been an advocate for the----          fossil-fuel industry. Mr. Manchin has personal business interests in coal, and West Virginia is a big----          producer of coal and natural gas.--------          He has angered Democrats several times with moves that helped waylay cornerstones of the Biden----          agenda. In addition to Build Back Better, he was reluctant to go along with party leaders' efforts to----          change the filibuster rules, and in March he said he couldn't support Mr. Biden's nominee to become----          the government's most powerful banking regulator, citing her views on climate policy.--------          In recent weeks Mr. Manchin has made international trips and spoken at several industry events----          promoting the need to help domestic oil and gas producers.--------          He went to an International Energy Agency meeting in Paris in March, where he promoted the use of----          carbon-capture technology to eliminate greenhouse-gas emissions from coal and other forms of fossil----          fuels.--------          On March 31, Mr. Manchin joined Sen. Mark Kelly (D., Ariz.) in a letter to Mr. Biden urging him to----          implement a new five-year drilling program for the Gulf of Mexico to replace one that is expiring this----          year. Earlier this month he toured oil-sands operations in Canada, promoting a push for more----          Canadian oil exports into the U.S.--------          In his public-speaking engagements in recent weeks, Mr. Manchin has said the White House should----          support stalled pipeline projects to take natural gas out of West Virginia and oil out of Canada,----          including the Keystone XL pipeline project, for which Mr. Biden revoked a key permit last year.--------          SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS--------          Will Sen. Joe Manchin find success with a new energy bill that makes fossil fuels a big part of the----          climate agenda? Join the conversation below.----------------          Mr. Manchin has said publicly that one of his top requests is for the White House to use wartime----          powers to overcome permitting and legal troubles that have prevented the completion of a key pipeline----          out of his home state.--------          He wants Mr. Biden to use the Defense Production Act to force through the completion of the----          Mountain Valley Pipeline, planned to transport natural gas from shale formations in northwestern West----          Virginia to southern Virginia.--------          "There's so much that we can be doing right now. We can't get a 42-inch pipeline out of the Marcellus----          Shale. It's ridiculous," Mr. Manchin said at a recent industry event. "So I talk to the White House,----          [which says,] 'What can we do to help you?' I said, 'Build the damn line.'

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----            Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, global auditing and consulting firms promised to leave the----            country. For some, the departure is proving to be difficult and potentially embarrassing.--------            Big consulting firms such as Accenture PLC and McKinsey & Co. have quit or stopped all client----            work. But the Big Four accounting firms are still there, trying to unwind complicated relationships with----            their Russian counterparts.--------TD----            The protracted pullout puts Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers in the----            awkward position of condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine but still working for Russian----            companies, many of them state-owned.--------            It also could be embarrassing or worse. PwC Russia, for example, is offering businesses in Russia----            "decision-making support in turbulent times" that includes the option of making "imports via another . .----            . country," according to its website.--------            Rerouting imports might be a way to sidestep sanctions imposed by the U.S. and Europe, said----            Charlie Steele, a former U.S. Treasury Department sanctions attorney.--------            "What they are suggesting certainly could be used as an avenue to try to evade sanctions," said Mr.----            Steele, a partner at consulting firm Forensic Risk Alliance. He added that the Russian accounting----            firm "might not have bad intent; they might think they are offering a lawful alternative."--------            A spokeswoman for PwC Russia declined to comment. A spokesman for PwC's international----            network said it "would be unacceptable for any member of the PwC Network to facilitate the violation----            of sanctions." PwC is "actively working on the separation" of the Russian firm from its network, the----            spokesman added.--------            The Big Four's long goodbye to Moscow also leaves them promising to abide by an array of----            sanctions against Russia, while operating in a country where those sanctions don't apply and could----            even be made illegal.--------            The Big Four's exits, once completed, will create stand-alone Russian firms built with international----            support and know-how. Those firms can now draw on that Western expertise in advising Russian----            companies on how best to minimize the impact of sanctions.--------            The Big Four will likely use these new firms for the now-complicated task of auditing the Russian----            operations of multinationals, according to people familiar with the matter. That could be one reason----            for the global firms to keep supporting their Russian counterparts, despite the separation.--------            Of the Big Four, Deloitte has the smallest Russian presence and appears closest to extricating itself----            from the country. It has removed much of its branding from its Russian business and aims to----            complete the separation early next month, according to a person close to the firm.--------            The other three remain in the throes of negotiations with their Russian firms, which still carry their----            brand, according to people familiar with the matter. The divorce process is proving complicated, the------------            people said. EY expects it to take another five to eight months to complete, according to a person----            close to the firm.--------            Some of the consulting giants have gotten out faster. Accenture this month said it has completed the----            transfer of its Russian business to local leadership. The new firm has until May 9 to change its name,----            and until May 23 to finalize its rebranding, Accenture said.--------            License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------CO          andac : Accenture PLC | usdtr : United States Department of the Treasury--------IN          i836 : Accounting | ibcs : Business/Consumer Services | iacc : Accounting/Consulting | i83951 :----            Management Consulting | icnsl : Business Consultancy----NS          gesanc : International Sanctions | neqac : Equities Asset Class News | ccat : Corporate/Industrial----            News | gcat : Political/General News | gdip : International Relations | gpir : Politics/International----            Relations | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters----RE          russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | usa : United States | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz :----            Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz----            : Europe | namz : North America | ussrz : CIS Countries----IPC         ABO--------PUB         Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN          Document J000000020220426ei4q0001a------------------------HD           The Ukraine Crisis: War Drains Russia's Arms Supply --- Moscow loses many big weapons,----             while Western sanctions impede replacement----BY           By Daniel Michaels and Matthew Luxmoore----WC           1,031 words----PD           26 April 2022----SN           The Wall Street Journal----SC           J----PG           A7----LA           English----CY           Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It has fired vast numbers----             of missiles, rockets and artillery shells and cut deep into supplies of newer, precision munitions,----             some analysts say.--------TD----             Russia has also lost more than 3,000 pieces of large equipment in battle, according to Oryx, an----             open-source intelligence tracker. The tally includes more than 500 main battle tanks, 300 armored----             fighting vehicles, 20 jet fighters and 30 helicopters.--------             Russia in recent years has produced around 250 tanks and 150 aircraft annually, said Mark----             Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in----             Washington. That means Ukrainian forces in two months have destroyed the equivalent of at least----             two years of Russian tank production.--------             The U.S. believes Russia overall has lost roughly one-fourth ofthe combat force it initially had to----             invade Ukraine, a senior Pentagon official said last week. The Russian Defense Ministry didn't----             respond to a request for comment.--------             For now, Russia's invasion forces can resupply from enormous equipment reserves, so the----             depletion is unlikely to affect the war's course quickly. Russia's official equipment rosters include----             tens of thousands of military land vehicles. But many require maintenance or repair, and a large----             portionare likely not operative and can be used only for spareparts, analysts who track Russia's----             military say.--------             If the war drags on for months, consumption and destruction of Russian materiel, coupled with----             Western financial sanctions and export restrictions, will impede Moscow's capacity to provision----             forces with better equipment, some analysts say. Russian defense contractors will similarly----             struggle to meet demand from both Moscow and export customers, or to invest in research and the----             development of new products, Western officials and analysts say.--------             "Our sanctions have pulled back the military-industrial complex of Russia, and it's not coming back----             anytime soon," Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said in Brussels on Thursday.--------             Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov in March said it was difficult to assess the impact of----             sanctions on Russia. "The goal of completing state orders was and remains a priority," he said.--------             The Kremlin hasn't confirmed the scale of equipment losses or how it plans to replenish its forces.----             Among the most significant losses it has confirmed is the sinking of the cruiser Moskva, the----             flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, which Ukraine claims to have hit with missiles. Russia says it sank----             while being towed during a storm.------------             Russia, and previously the Soviet Union, built military strategies based on huge quantities of fairly----             basic weapons to overwhelm adversaries. Moscow at times has appeared ready to suffer big----             losses to achieve its goals, some analysts say, relying on its stockpile of mostly Soviet-era----             weapons and many of the components needed to manufacture them. The approach contrasts with----             the West, which has focused on developing fewer but superior weapons that can better survive----             battle.--------             Replacing Russia's lost modern combat jets and helicopters would cost hundreds of millions of----             dollars, and Western sanctions are designed to impede resupply.--------             Even less-sophisticated land vehicles could pose a replacement challenge for Russian defense----             companies, which haven't extensively modernized production systems since Soviet times and still----             rely heavily on now-sanctioned foreign equipment, machine tools and precision components such----             as electronics and bearings. Russia's military-industrial sector has shrunk from its Soviet scale,----             further complicating a production surge like during World War II.--------             "We don't have the men, we don't have the equipment, we don't have the components," a Russian----             military analyst said.--------             While sanctions and industrial bottlenecks are unlikely to quickly affect battlefields in Ukraine, they----             could if the war grinds on.--------             "The real test for the industry regarding inputs probably will occur in the coming months or in next----             year" as stockpiles of components with content under sanctions get depleted and Russia runs low----             on foreign-made microchips now used in most military hardware, said Tomas Malmlof, a senior----             military analyst at the Swedish Defense Research Agency.--------             Defense-manufacturing problems that hit exports would weaken Russia's economy, which has----             been battered by the unprecedented sanctions. Russia is the world's second-largest weapons----             exporter behind the U.S., and arms are among Russia's largest exports aside from natural----             resources, which dominate the country's economy. Russia exports arms to over 45 countries and----             has accounted for around 20% of global arms sales since 2016.--------             Hurdles even impede Russian defense exports that don't rely on foreign inputs, because of----             sanctions imposed on Russia's banking system. State-owned arms manufacturer Almaz-Antey in----             March said it was unable to receive roughly $1 billion in payment from clients, including India and----             Egypt, and urged the Russian government to help military companies by developing systems to----             process foreign transactions.--------             "Right now, because of the imposed sanctions, the processing of payments has stalled,"----             Almaz-Antey's finance director, Rustam Ulumbekov, told Russia's TASS news agency. "And the----             sums are colossal." Almaz-Antey didn't respond to a request for comment.--------             Russia's battlefield performance, beyond depleting its armories, could hurt export sales. Ukrainian----             forces' large-scale destruction of Russian military equipment using modern Western-supplied----             drones, artillery and portable missile launchers undermines the reputation of Moscow's arms, said----             Scott Boston, a senior defense analyst at Rand Corp.--------             "When their weapons are being shown to be blown up all over the place, there's a general----             perception that maybe this equipment isn't that good," he said.--------             -----------             Robert Wall and Sharon Weinberger contributed to this article.--------------------             License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service----------------IN           i364 : Aerospace Products/Parts | iaer : Aerospace/Defense | iindstrls : Industrial Goods--------NS           gvio : Military Action | c13 : Regulation/Government Policy | gesanc : International Sanctions |----             gtrade : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | nimage : Images | gweap : Weapons Programs | reqrad :----             Suggested Reading Aerospace/Defense | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | e51 : Trade/External----             Payments | ecat : Economic News | gcat : Political/General News | gcns : National/Public Security |----             gdef : Armed Forces | gdip : International Relations | gpir : Politics/International Relations | grisk :----             Risk News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter | redit :----             Selection of Top Stories/Trends/Analysis | reqr : Suggested Reading Industry News----RE           russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | ussrz : CIS Countries | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries |----             devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern----             Europe | eurz : Europe----IPC          PIC--------PUB          Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN           Document J000000020220426ei4q0000y------------------------CLM      WSJ Podcast Minute Briefing----HD       Russia Warns of Nuclear Conflict With the West--------WC       327 words----PD       26 April 2022----ET       15:35----SN       WSJ Podcasts----SC       WSJPOD----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          The Biden administration's aim in the Ukraine war is to see Russia's military capabilities degraded and----          Ukraine's strengthened, to prevent Moscow from attempting to conquer territory by force in the future,----          U.S. officials said Monday.--------          "We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in----          invading Ukraine," Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said after he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken----          became the highest-level U.S. officials to visit the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv since Russia invaded----          Ukraine on Feb. 24.--------TD----          A senior U.S. official said after Messrs. Blinken and Austin returned from Kyiv, "However this ends up,----          Russia will be in a much weaker position. Ukraine will be in a much stronger position to further deter----          against any renewed aggression once this is over."--------          Meanwhile, on Monday the U.S. said it would return diplomats to Ukraine and work to re-establish its----          embassy in Kyiv, and the White House said President Biden would appoint an ambassador to Ukraine,----          the first since 2019.--------          In an attempt to stem the flow of heavy weapons from the U.S. and other allies to the front lines in----          Ukraine, Russia on Monday hit several Ukrainian railway hubs with missile strikes, severely disrupting----          rail traffic.--------          While U.S. officials said Mr. Austin's remarks didn't reflect an administration policy shift, the comments----          demonstrated the evolution of the U.S. government's thinking on what it sees as its endgame in the----          war.--------          Initially, the U.S. planned to help Ukraine maintain an insurgency against an occupying Russian force,----          but Russia failed to achieve its goal of subjugating Ukraine, and shifted its own aims toward----          consolidating its hold on the eastern Donbas region.--------          While administration officials have said the U.S. won't deploy military personnel to fight Russian troops----          there, Washington has committed to sending billions of dollars of increasingly heavy weaponry to help----          the Ukrainians fend off the Russian invasion and strengthen Kyiv's negotiating position for an eventual----          end to the conflict. Mr. Biden has suggested that the U.S. doesn't want to see President Vladimir Putin----          of Russia remain in power and considers him a war criminal.--------          Ukrainian forces, with U.S. and international assistance, have inflicted devastating losses on Russian----          forces. As many as 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in the war, along with more than 2,000----          Russian armored vehicles destroyed or captured, as well as 60 helicopters and jet fighters, the U.K.----          government said Monday. In addition, sanctions and export controls have hampered Moscow's efforts----          to replenish its depleted stocks of arms over the longer term.--------          "In terms of Russia's war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already succeeded," Mr.----          Blinken said Monday. "We don't know how the rest of this war will unfold, but we do know that a----          sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene."----------------          The Kremlin didn't respond to Mr. Austin's remarks on a weakened Russia. Later Monday, a senior----          U.S. defense official said his comments were consistent with administration policy dating back months,----          which is to prevent Russia from threatening its neighbors.--------          "Austin was not signaling any kind of administration change with respect to Russia," the official said.----          "He's not talking about a toe-to-toe with Russia."--------          A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said, "We have also said for months that----          we intend to make this invasion a strategic failure for Russia."--------          The Russian missile strikes hit rail infrastructure in the central Ukrainian region of Rivne, local officials----          said. They followed other missile attacks late Sunday in Poltava that struck an electricity plant and a----          fuel refinery. The governor of Ukraine's central province of Vinnytsia said Monday that Russian missile----          attacks had hit critical infrastructure in the region and that there were people dead and injured.--------          The strikes came hours after Messrs. Austin and Blinken told President Volodymyr Zelensky of----          Ukraine that Washington would reopen its embassy in Kyiv and provide Ukraine with $322 million in----          foreign military assistance to allow Kyiv to buy needed weapons. Russia's ambassador to the U.S.,----          Anatoly Antonov, demanded in a diplomatic note that Washington stop supplying weapons to Ukraine,----          Russian news agency RIA reported Monday.--------          Mr. Zelensky said the $3.4 billion in defense support provided by the U.S. so far had been the biggest----          contribution to Ukraine's defense efforts.--------          The White House said Mr. Biden planned to nominate Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to----          Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine. The position has been vacant since the last Senate-confirmed----          ambassador to the country, Marie Yovanovitch, was ousted by then-President Donald Trump in 2019.--------          Messrs. Austin and Blinken hailed Ukraine's success in fending off Russia's initial attack on Kyiv and----          maintaining its sovereignty. Still, U.S. officials said they recognized that Mr. Putin could choose to----          escalate the war, including possibly with weapons of mass destruction. Having struck Odessa in recent----          days, the senior official said, Mr. Putin is "looking at the entire expanse of the Black Sea coastline."--------          Senior U.S. military officers at a facility in Poland described an accelerating logistical effort for----          supplying weapons and materiel to Ukraine, as well as a regional effort to increase troop levels and----          exercises with North Atlantic Treaty Organization members along the alliance's eastern flank.--------          Seven 155mm artillery pieces, along with their tow vehicles, are being processed through the facility,----          adding to the 18 howitzers the U.S. has already provided to Ukraine, a senior defense official said. Six----          dozen U.S. howitzers are being sent to Ukraine under a new aid package.--------          -----------          Mauro Orru in Barcelona and Courtney McBride and Gordon Lubold in Washington contributed to this----          article.--------          License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------CO        nato : North Atlantic Treaty Organization--------NS        gdip : International Relations | gcat : Political/General News | gvio : Military Action | npag : Page One----          Stories | gcns : National/Public Security | gpir : Politics/International Relations | grisk : Risk News | ncat----          : Content Types----RE        ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | usa : United States | usdc : Washington DC | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS----          Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----          Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe | namz : North America | uss : Southern U.S. | ussrz : CIS----          Countries----IPC       DEF--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document J000000020220426ei4q0001s------------------------CLM      Global View----HD       Russia Squeezes Kazakhstan--------BY       By Walter Russell Mead----WC       820 words----PD       26 April 2022----SN       The Wall Street Journal----SC       J----PG       A15----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         Almaty, Kazakhstan -- Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has exposed deep failures in Russian----         strategic culture and undermined Russian prestige across the West. Viewed from Almaty, in the foothills----         of the Tian Shan mountains, however, the Russian leader looms large. It is not only that Moscow's----         propaganda still shapes the worldview of Kazakhstan's sizable Russian minority (about 20% of the----         population, heavily concentrated in regions adjacent to Russia). This also has been a year that, for----         many in Kazakhstan, underlined how much power Russia has over the future of this oil- and----         mineral-rich Central Asian country.--------         Thinly populated Kazakhstan, where 19 million people inhabit a territory roughly the area of Alaska and----         Texas combined, occupies a strategic position at the geographical center of Asia.--------TD----         Its border with Russia, at more than 4,200 miles, is the longest land frontier in the world, and it also----         shares a roughly 950-mile border with China. It accounts for more than half the total gross domestic----         product of the five Central Asian republics and, in addition to enormous oil reserves, it has the world's----         second-largest supply of uranium.--------         When Kazakhs speak of the "January events," they aren't talking about the shambolic attempt by----         pro-Trump protesters to derail the certification of Joe Biden's electoral victory. In Kazakhstan, the----         January events started with nationwide anticorruption protests against the alleged wholesale looting of----         the economy by former longtime ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev and his allies. While the details of what----         happened next are unclear, armed rebels infiltrated the previously peaceful protests, and the ensuing----         street clashes in Almaty led to more than 200 deaths and almost 10,000 arrests. The armed rebels are----         widely believed to be linked to Nazarbayev allies hoping to exploit the unrest and return to power.--------         The chaos ended when a Russian-led intervention force arrived to signal Moscow's support for the----         current president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. The Russian intervention was well-planned and----         well-executed, and the foreign forces left the country without firing a shot.--------         Mr. Nazarbayev, who retained key positions after formally stepping down from the presidency in 2019,----         has since faded into the background. While Mr. Tokayev now appears to be in firm control, ordinary----         Kazakhs can only speculate on why Mr. Putin came to his rescue and what deals if any have been----         made.--------         The second demonstration of Russian power came with the war in Ukraine. While the war has not gone----         well for Russia on the ground, the resulting waves of sanctions have upended the Kazakh economy.--------         The local currency tanked, then recovered, in lockstep with the ruble. Given the powerful role of----         Russian banks in the domestic economy, Kazakh authorities have struggled to manage the impact of----         Western sanctions on the financial system.--------         For landlocked Kazakhstan, whose economy depends largely on oil exports through a pipeline----         terminating in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, the fear that Western oil sanctions will hit----         Kazakh oil in Russian pipelines is real. Worse, the Novorossiysk terminal has been largely shut down----         since March, ostensibly because of storm damage. While smaller pipelines carry some Kazakh oil to--------         China and Turkey, the Novorossiysk shutdown threatens the country's principal source of export----         earnings at a time when the local economy hasn't fully recovered from the consequences of the----         January clashes and the Covid pandemic.--------         In Kazakhstan, it isn't hard to find people who believe that Russia deliberately turned off the oil tap. The----         pipeline shutdown pushes world oil prices higher, puts pressure on Europe, hits the U.S. oil firms that----         have substantial investments in Kazakhstan -- and reminds the Kazakhs who is in charge.--------         There is little doubt here that no country has as much influence over Kazakhstan's future as the----         colossus to the north. That reality disheartens many here who remember the savage repression of the----         Soviet era, fear Mr. Putin's ultimate intentions, and bemoan the effect of Russian tolerance of corruption----         on the local economy.--------         Many Kazakhs, however, see few alternatives to close relations with Moscow. American influence----         appears to be fading in the region following the retreat from Afghanistan, and Beijing's persecution of----         ethnic Kazakhs in nearby Xinjiang has reinforced a deep cultural distrust of China.--------         Now that the Biden administration has made weakening Russia a major strategic goal, that calculation----         could change. Along with the Netherlands and Switzerland, the U.S. is one of the three largest investors----         in Kazakhstan, outpacing both Russia and China. As Washington policy makers look for ways to----         counter Russian influence and complicate Mr. Putin's life, helping Kazakhstan reduce its dependence----         on Moscow-controlled pipelines, reform its economy, and coordinate with neighboring Central Asian----         states to limit the influence of both China and Russia might be a good place to start.--------         License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------NS       gcivds : Civil Unrest | gvio : Military Action | ncolu : Columns | nedc : Commentaries/Opinions | gcat :----         Political/General News | gcns : National/Public Security | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content Types | nfact----         : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter----RE       russ : Russia | kazk : Kazakhstan | almaty : Almaty | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS----         Countries | casiaz : Central Asia | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing----         Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe | ussrz : CIS Countries----IPC      IGV--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document J000000020220426ei4q0001l------------------------HD          The Ukraine Crisis: Career U.S. Diplomat Named Kyiv Envoy--------BY          By Ken Thomas and Mauro Orru----WC          243 words----PD          26 April 2022----SN          The Wall Street Journal----SC          J----PG          A7----LA          English----CY          Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          Cyberattacks on three European wind-energy companies since the start of the war in Ukraine have----          raised concerns that hackers sympathetic to Russia are trying to cause mayhem in a sector set to----          benefit from efforts to lessen reliance on Russian oil and gas.--------          The companies attacked haven't publicly attributed the hacks to a particular criminal group or country----          and Russia has consistently denied it launches cyberattacks.--------TD----          But the timing of the attacks suggests potential links to supporters of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, said----          Christoph Zipf, a spokesman for WindEurope, a Brussels-based industry group.--------          Serious cyberattacks on industrial equipment aren't common and take significant knowledge to----          prepare, security experts say.--------          The three companies targeted in the attacks are all based in Germany. Deutsche Windtechnik AG,----          which specializes in the maintenance of wind turbines, was hacked in April. Remote-control systems----          for about 2,000 wind turbines in Germany were down for about a day after the attack, the company----          said.--------          Turbine maker Nordex SE said it discovered a security incident March 31 that forced it to shut its----          information-technology systems. Conti, a ransomware group that has declared support for the Russian----          government, said this month that it was responsible for the attack.--------          Enercon GmbH, also a turbine maker, said it was "collateral damage" in an attack on a satellite----          company in February that happened "at almost exactly the same time that Russian troops invaded----          Ukraine." The attack knocked out remote control of 5,800 of Enercon's wind turbines, though they----          continued to operate on auto mode.--------          "We need high IT security standards" because the growing renewable-energy sector will become a----          bigger target for hackers, said Matthias Brandt, director of Deutsche Windtechnik, which has around----          2,000 employees. "The crisis in Russia and Ukraine shows us that renewables are replacing oil and----          gas in the future," he said.--------          The European Union started reducing Russian energy imports this month.--------          Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has rejected EU-wide sanctions on Russian fuel, arguing such a----          move would damage the German economy. The country moved up its plan to reach nearly 100%----          renewable energy electricity by 2035 and wean itself off Russian oil and coal imports this year. Still, a----          German official said in late March that Russia accounted for 40% of the country's natural-gas imports,----          down from 55% four weeks earlier but still substantially above the EU average.--------          Cybersecurity experts working with Deutsche Windtechnik are investigating whether the ransomware----          attack used Conti malware, Mr. Brandt said. Chats from Conti ransomware users leaked online in----          March revealed connections to Russian security services. These hackers also discussed targeting----          organizations they consider to be working against Russia.----------------          U.S. utilities aiming to provide alternative energy to Europe have also been targets, said Jim Guinn,----          who leads consulting firm Accenture PLC's global cybersecurity business for energy, utilities,----          chemicals and mining.--------          A hacker who manages to infect the industrial equipment that controls wind turbines could manipulate----          the machines' brakes to stop power production, said Trond Solbert, managing director for----          cybersecurity at Norwegian risk-management company DNV GL. That could disrupt services to----          customers and revenue for producers, Mr. Solbert said. A simpler strike on local internet-connected----          services could interfere with the remote monitoring systems of wind farms, he added.--------          The attack on Deutsche Windtechnik hit internal IT systems, not the industrial systems that control its----          turbines, Mr. Brandt said. He found out the company's systems weren't working properly when the----          technology department called him around 6 a.m. on April 12. An hour or two later, IT staff drove to a----          data center in northern Germany to find Deutsche Windtechnik had been hit with ransomware the----          previous night.--------          Machines displayed codes that looked like hieroglyphs, Mr. Brandt said, indicating servers had been----          encrypted with malware. Later that day, employees found an electronic note from hackers instructing----          the company to contact them to restore their data. By the next day, Deutsche Windtechnik had----          resolved most of the issues and didn't reach out to the hackers, he said.--------          License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------IN        iwind : Wind Energy | i163 : Renewable Energy Generation | i32 : Machinery | iindstrls : Industrial----          Goods | i1 : Energy | i16 : Electricity/Gas Utilities | i16101 : Electric Power Generation | ieutil : Electric----          Utilities | iutil : Utilities----NS        ghack : Cybercrime/Hacking | gcvir : Malware | gvio : Military Action | gcrim : Crime/Legal Action | c12 :----          Corporate Crime/Legal Action | neqac : Equities Asset Class News | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News |----          gcat : Political/General News | gcns : National/Public Security | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content----          Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter----RE        russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | eurz : Europe | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz :----          Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | ussrz----          : CIS Countries----IPC       ABO--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document J000000020220426ei4q0000x------------------------HD      The Strategic Logic of Russia's War on Ukraine--------BY      By Chris Blattman----WC      999 words----PD      26 April 2022----SN      The Wall Street Journal----SC      J----PG      A17----LA      English----CY      Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----        The verdict is in: Russia invaded Ukraine for two reasons. One is Moscow's obsessive pursuit of----        nationalist and imperial ambitions -- unifying the two countries and eliminating a separate Ukrainian----        identity. The other is Vladimir Putin's misperception -- he is an insulated, overconfident autocrat who----        misplayed his hand.--------        These theories are surely true, but years of working in and writing about wars have taught me there's----        usually more to the story. Whether it's a world war, a U.S. invasion or a West African rebellion,----        observers are quick to focus on passions and mistakes and to demonize leaders who launch a conflict.----        Yet most wars have strategic roots as well, ones that work in concert with passions and mistakes.----        Ignoring this makes finding a path to peace difficult.--------TD----        For all its pluckiness, Ukraine was weak, a small country with no allies. Its economy had stagnated for----        decades. Russia had grown economically and militarily while Mr. Putin consolidated control. The----        countries of Western Europe gave up nuclear power and found themselves at a huge strategic----        disadvantage versus their energy supplier, Russia. All this gave Mr. Putin immense leverage over----        Ukraine and Western Europe.--------        Despite Ukraine's weakness, recent trends alarmed Mr. Putin and his inner circle. The Ukrainian people----        had twice tossed out Russia-leaning leaders in revolutions in the past 20 years. Ukraine was a society----        with which many Russian citizens identified and a powerful example for an uprising against Mr. Putin's----        regime.--------        Mr. Putin could wield his leverage to extinguish the threat, but war would be expensive and risky, so he----        first tried other means. He spent years influencing Ukrainian politics with money, propaganda,----        assassinations and support for separatists. These risky investments didn't pay off -- and might have----        pushed Ukrainians closer to the West and democratic government.--------        This was a worrisome trend for Mr. Putin. As Ukraine entrenched its freedoms, regime change there----        became more difficult. As Kyiv obtained more missiles and drones, the costs of invasion grew. Mr.----        Putin's leverage over Ukraine was reaching its peak. Russia had one last tool, invasion, and a closing----        window to use it.--------        However reprehensible, this was realpolitik. Mr. Putin was telling Ukraine: It's time to acknowledge----        Russia's strength. Give something up. Adopt neutrality. Refuse new weapons. Renounce your ambition----        to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Grant separatist-controlled regions autonomy. Allow me to----        meddle in your politics. Most of Russia's neighbors had been compelled to make similar sacrifices.--------        There are three interlocked strategic logics at work in this interpretation of events. The first stems from----        the lack of domestic checks on Mr. Putin's power. As a personalized ruler, he's insulated from the costs----        borne by average Russians -- such as the privations of living under punishing sanctions, or sons dying----        in battle. Since he could ignore these horrors, he was too quick to use violence. This also gave him an----        incentive to invade. Ukrainian democracy presented a threat not because it would cause harm to----        ordinary Russians. Rather, it presented a powerful and (to Mr. Putin's mind) dangerous example for----        Russians dissatisfied with authoritarian rule. An unchecked Mr. Putin was also free to pursue any----        emotional attachments to an expansion of Russian power and identity.------------        The second logic is known as a commitment problem. It's a classic strategic dilemma that starts with a----        closing window of opportunity. After every other measure had failed, Mr. Putin could halt Ukraine's----        democratic and Western shift only by threatening to attack. Ukraine could avoid the dilemma only by----        accepting Russia's political interference. These unjust sacrifices happen all the time, but the popular----        mood in Ukraine wouldn't tolerate a politician who made such concessions. Kyiv couldn't give in to----        Moscow's demand that it give up on democracy -- a commitment problem.--------        The final strategic logic arises from uncertainty. Many people, including most military analysts, were----        surprised by how things turned out. Russian forces proved less competent than expected. Ukraine's----        resolve to fight exceeded expectations, as did Western unity on sanctions. We shouldn't forget how hard----        all these things were to predict. As every poker player can tell you, when the truth is uncertain and your----        opponent has an incentive to bluff, the best strategy often is to call -- make the other players show their----        hands. Then you'll have the truth of the matter. In this fog, Mr. Putin gambled and lost.--------        Historians and political scientists usually need both psychological and strategic forces to explain wars.----        Take World War I. Popular accounts stress that naive and nationalistic leaders sleepwalked into war.----        But there were strategic forces too -- Russia's imminent rise, the Allies' uncertain resolve, and Europe's----        unchecked leadership. These helped propel flawed European leaders into war and explain why they----        fought for years.--------        Likewise, in 2003, an unchecked Saddam Hussein had incentives to restart his nuclear research----        program -- a commitment problem exacerbated by uncertainty. Yes, there were ideological incentives,----        intelligence failures and gross misperceptions on the American side too. Yet popular psychology----        provides only partial explanations.--------        In 2022 Mr. Putin was insulated, overconfident and blindly nationalist. But every politician's aspirations----        exceed his capabilities. The interplay of Mr. Putin's domestic freedom to act, multiple uncertainties, and----        Ukraine's hard-to-reverse democratic drift narrowed the range of possible bargains to the point that the----        Russian president's misperceptions and ideology pointed to war.--------        Getting this diagnosis right matters, because adversaries use different carrots and sticks with a----        calculating, unchecked leader than they do with a delusional ideologue. No one should want to risk----        misjudging Vladimir Putin the same way he misjudged Ukraine.--------        -----------        Mr. Blattman is the author of "Why We Fight: The Roots of War and the Paths to Peace," and a----        professor at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy.--------        License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------NS      gcat : Political/General News | gvexe : Executive Branch | gvio : Military Action | nedc :----        Commentaries/Opinions | gcns : National/Public Security | gpir : Politics/International Relations | gpol :----        Domestic Politics | grisk : Risk News | gvbod : Government Bodies | ncat : Content Types | nfact :----        Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter----RE      ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----        Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe | ussrz :----        CIS Countries----IPC     IGV--------PUB     Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN      Document J000000020220426ei4q0000o------------------------CLM     Best of the Web Today----SE      Opinion----HD      Florida, Utah Take on ESG Farce; If you thought Disney made the 'corporate social responsibility'----        crowd look bad, how about Russia?----BY      By James Freeman----WC      1,230 words----PD      26 April 2022----ET      01:58----SN      The Wall Street Journal Online----SC      WSJO----LA      English----CY      Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----        Florida's effort to defend its schools against the Walt Disney Co. has exposed the empty rhetoric of----        "stakeholder capitalism." Now Utah is shining a light on the broader movement for "corporate social----        responsibility." In both cases, aggressive virtue signals may conceal political agendas that are not in the----        interest of consumers, investors, workers or voters. Moreover, attempts to grade companies on how----        responsible they are have recently yielded results that are almost beyond belief.--------        Karen Pierog reports in the Bond Buyer on Utah's scrap with one of the credit-ratings giants:--------TD----        Utah's top elected officials demanded on Thursday that S&P Global Ratings cease applying----        environmental, social, and governance factors to the state through the use of what they called a----        politicized rating system based on indeterminate factors.--------        A letter to S&P signed by Gov. Spencer Cox, Treasurer Marlo Oaks, other state constitutional----        officeholders, legislative leaders, and Utah's Congressional delegation, stated their objection "to any----        ESG ratings, ESG credit indicators, or any other ESG scoring system that calls out ESG factors----        separate from, in addition to, or apart from traditional credit ratings."--------        Utah enjoys a top credit rating but worries that political factors may pollute the process of judging the----        creditworthiness of bond issuers. The letter states:--------        S&P acknowledges that "having a social mission and strong [environmental, social, and governance]----        characteristics does not necessarily correlate with strong creditworthiness and vice versa." S&P's ESG----        credit indicators politicize what should be a purely financial decision. This politicization has manifested----        itself in the capital markets where, for example, banks are pressured to cut off capital to the oil, gas,----        coal, and firearms industries. ESG is a political rating and should be characterized as such...--------        No financial firm should substitute its political judgments for objective financial analysis, especially on----        matters that are unrelated to the underlying businesses, assets, and cash flows it evaluates. This is----        especially true of a properly regulated independent entity like S&P that is charged with providing----        objective clarity and insight. The use of ESG-related quantitative metrics and analytical frameworks----        confounds the distinction between subjective normative judgments and objective financial assessments.----        It is therefore unconscionable for S&P to weigh in on indeterminate and normative questions...--------        While it may be difficult to deliver "forward looking opinion[s] about the capacity and willingness of an----        entity to meet its financial commitments as they come due," integrating this analysis with the political----        whims of the day is unacceptable. If they are not political, but are instead financially material, then they----        would be captured in the traditional credit analysis. ESG indicators are, therefore, not necessary.--------        So far, S&P isn't responding to the letter from Utah. A report from the company states:------------------------        Our ESG credit indicators provide additional disclosure and transparency at the entity level and reflect----        our opinion of the influence that environmental, social, and governance factors have on our credit rating----        analysis.--------        In S&P's defense, one could argue that they are simply responding to demands from political activists----        within pension funds and large financial institutions—and Biden administration financial regulators.--------        Beyond S&P's ESG credit indicators related to the firm's credit ratings, the Utah officials also take aim at----        ESG scores issued by a separate part of S&P. The Utahans write:--------        Even advocates of ESG accept that there is no agreed-upon standard for ESG reporting and that----        various ESG sub-components are inherently incommensurable. How, for example, should environmental----        goals be prioritized over social ones, or governmental goals over environmental ones? This is to say----        nothing of what factors may populate the social realm...--------        Nevertheless, S&P has pressed ahead and in the process generated some truly baffling results. For----        example, S&P gave Russian-controlled energy producers higher ESG ratings than similar entities in the----        U.S. Russian energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft outscored American energy companies ExxonMobil----        and Chevron on S&P's ESG scale. This despite the fact that Vladimir Putin's Russian government is the----        majority owner of Gazprom and owns a 40% stake in Rosneft—the same government that recently----        invaded neighboring Ukraine in an unprovoked and unjustifiable attack, in violation of international law.----        That attack appears to be degenerating into a total war on all Ukrainians, including noncombatant----        civilians, in violation of the Geneva Conventions, and has resulted in thousands of civilian casualties and----        over 10 million displaced persons to date.--------        While S&P recently removed all Russian company scores from their website, it is inconceivable how----        these energy giants, controlled by a corrupt and reckless regime—and having been sanctioned for that----        regime's misadventures before—managed to cobble together ESG scores up until a few weeks ago that----        exceeded those of law-abiding American companies critical to U.S. energy security.... S&P also gave----        the Chinese state-owned China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation a higher ESG score than----        ExxonMobil and Chevron, despite human rights violations by the Chinese.--------        We also note that Russia's leading bank, Sberbank was sanctioned by both the U.S. and the European----        Union in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and was cut off from the U.S.-led financial----        system upon Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year. Inexplicably, however, Sberbank's S&P ESG score----        was higher than that of the largest American bank, J.P. Morgan.--------        As for the credit indicators related specifically to S&P's credit ratings, the Russian energy firms did score----        lower than the U.S. energy firms on governance, but had the same scores on social and environmental----        factors. Are we to believe that Putin-controlled companies are just as socially and environmentally sound----        as U.S. firms controlled by shareholders?--------        It appears that ESG is not about creating fair assessments of corporate behavior. So what is it really----        about? Utah Treasurer Marlo Oaks takes a crack in a release about the state's letter:--------        ESG is about controlling and forcing behaviors.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----                   The Biden administration's aim in the Ukraine war is to see Russia's military capabilities----                   degraded and Ukraine's strengthened, to prevent Moscow from attempting to conquer----                   territory by force in the future, U.S. officials said Monday.--------                   "We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has----                   done in invading Ukraine," Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said after he and Secretary of----                   State Antony Blinken became the highest-level U.S. officials to visit the Ukrainian capital of----                   Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.--------TD----                   A senior U.S. official told reporters after Messrs. Blinken and Austin returned from Kyiv,----                   "However this ends up, Russia will be in a much weaker position. Ukraine will be in a much----                   stronger position to further deter against any renewed aggression once this is over."--------                   Meanwhile, on Monday the U.S. said it would return diplomats to Ukraine and work to----                   re-establish its embassy in the capital of Kyiv. The White House said President Biden would----                   appoint an ambassador to Ukraine, the first since 2019.--------                   In an attempt to stem the flow of heavy weapons from the U.S. and other allies to the front----                   lines in Ukraine, Russia on Monday hit several Ukrainian railway hubs with missile strikes,----                   severely disrupting rail traffic.--------                   While U.S. officials said Mr. Austin's remarks didn't reflect an administration policy shift, the----                   comments demonstrated the evolution of the U.S. government's thinking on what it ultimately----                   sees as its endgame in the war.--------                   Initially, the U.S. planned to help Ukraine maintain an insurgency against an occupying----                   Russian force, but Russia failed to achieve its goal of subjugating Ukraine, and shifted its----                   own aims toward consolidating its hold on the eastern Donbas region.--------                   While administration officials have said the U.S. won't deploy military personnel to fight----                   Russian troops there, Washington has committed to sending billions of dollars of----                   increasingly heavy weaponry to help the Ukrainians fend off the Russian invasion and----                   strengthen Kyiv's negotiating position for an eventual end to the conflict. Mr. Biden has----                   suggested that the U.S. doesn't want to see Russian President Vladimir Putin remain in----                   power and considers him a war criminal.--------                   Ukrainian forces, backed by U.S. and international security assistance, have inflicted----                   devastating losses on Russian forces. As many as 15,000 Russian troops have been killed----                   in the war, along with more than 2,000 Russian armored vehicles destroyed or captured, as----                   well as 60 helicopters and jet fighters, the U.K. government said Monday. In addition,----------------                   sanctions and export controls have hampered Moscow's efforts to replenish its depleted----                   stocks of arms over the longer term.--------                   "In terms of Russia's war aims, Russia has already failed and Ukraine has already----                   succeeded," Mr. Blinken said Monday. "We don't know how the rest of this war will unfold,----                   but we do know that a sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than----                   Vladimir Putin is on the scene."--------                   The Kremlin didn't respond to Mr. Austin's remarks on a weakened Russia. Later Monday, a----                   senior U.S. defense official said his comments were consistent with administration policy----                   dating back months, which is to prevent Russia from threatening its neighbors.--------                   "Austin was not signaling any kind of administration change with respect to Russia," the----                   official said. "He's not talking about a toe-to-toe with Russia."--------                   A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said, "We have also said for----                   months that we intend to make this invasion a strategic failure for Russia."--------                   The Russian missile strikes hit rail infrastructure in the central Ukrainian region of Rivne,----                   local officials said. They followed other missile attacks late Sunday in Poltava that struck an----                   electricity plant and a fuel refinery. The governor of Ukraine's central province of Vinnytsia----                   said early Monday that Russian missile attacks had hit critical infrastructure in the region and----                   that there were people dead and injured, though he provided no details.--------                   The strikes came hours after Messrs. Austin and Blinken told Ukrainian President Volodymyr----                   Zelensky that Washington would reopen its embassy in Kyiv and provide Ukraine with $322----                   million in foreign military assistance to allow Kyiv to buy needed weapons. Russia's----                   ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, demanded in a diplomatic note that Washington----                   stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, Russian news agency RIA reported Monday.--------                   Mr. Zelensky said the $3.4 billion in defense support provided by the U.S. so far had been----                   the biggest contribution to Ukraine's defense efforts.--------------------                   Wreckage left over from a late March bombing of a Kyiv mall in a Russian airstrike. PHOTO:----                   Justyna Mielnikiewicz/MAPS for The Wall Street Journal--------                   The White House said Monday that Mr. Biden planned to nominate Bridget Brink, the current----                   U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine. The position has been vacant----                   since the last Senate-confirmed ambassador to the country, Marie Yovanovitch, was ousted----                   by then-President Donald Trump in 2019.--------                   Messrs. Austin and Blinken hailed Ukraine's success in fending off Russia's initial attack on----                   Kyiv and maintaining its sovereignty. Still, U.S. officials said they recognized that Mr. Putin----                   could choose to escalate the war, including possibly with weapons of mass destruction.--------                   Having struck Odessa in recent days, the senior official said, Mr. Putin is "looking at the----                   entire expanse of the Black Sea coastline."--------                   Senior U.S. military officers at a facility in Poland described an accelerating logistical effort----                   for supplying weapons and materiel to Ukraine, as well as a regional effort to increase troop----                   levels and exercises with North Atlantic Treaty Organization members along the alliance's----                   eastern flank.--------                   Seven 155-mm artillery pieces, along with their tow vehicles, are being processed through----                   the facility, adding to the 18 howitzers the U.S. has already provided to Ukraine, a senior----                   defense official said. Six dozen U.S. howitzers are being sent to Ukraine under a new aid----                   package, and rounds of 155-mm artillery were visible on pallets at the Polish facility.------------                   The focus on heavy artillery and armored vehicles comes as Russia removes some of its----                   forces from around cities in northern Ukraine and focuses instead on the eastern Donbas----                   region, in what is expected to be a high-stakes conflict on wide-open terrain.--------                   Mr. Austin on Tuesday will join other defense ministers, including Ukraine's Oleksii Reznikov,----                   and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at a gathering at Ramstein Air Force Base in----                   Germany. The topics to be discussed will include updating the representatives of more than----                   20 countries about the latest intelligence from the battlefield in Ukraine, security assistance----                   to Kyiv and strengthening NATO's defense-industrial base in the long term to support----                   Ukraine's defense, the defense official said.--------                   One problem to be addressed at the gathering is Ukraine's need for what NATO considers to----                   be nonstandard ammunition and weapons systems, as well as discussions about whether----                   the former Soviet republic could shift toward standard NATO equipment, the official said. For----                   example, howitzers designed to fire 152-mm rounds can't accommodate the 155-mm caliber.--------                   The return of a U.S. diplomatic presence to Ukraine, which follows moves by the U.K., Italy,----                   France and other countries, will help American and Ukrainian officials to coordinate aid and----                   other efforts in person and to prepare for a future consular operation to address the needs of----                   citizens of both countries, a State Department official said. The defense official declined to----                   say whether U.S. Marines would help guard the embassy in Kyiv, saying the military would----                   respond to the State Department's needs.--------                   Asked whether the increased U.S. focus on Ukraine risks increasing tensions with Russia,----                   the State Department official said Washington has no plans to involve its troops in the----                   conflict.--------                   Mauro Orru in Barcelona and Courtney McBride and Gordon Lubold in Washington----                   contributed to this article.--------                   Write to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com and Thomas Grove at----                   thomas.grove@wsj.com--------                   U.S. Wants to See Russia Weakened, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin Says After Ukraine----                   Visit--------IN                 iaer : Aerospace/Defense | iindstrls : Industrial Goods--------NS                 gdip : International Relations | gvdef : Defense Department | gcat : Political/General News |----                   gpir : Politics/International Relations | gvbod : Government Bodies | gvio : Military Action |----                   ncolu : Columns | nimage : Images | gdef : Armed Forces | gcns : National/Public Security |----                   gpol : Domestic Politics | grisk : Risk News | gvexe : Executive Branch | ncat : Content Types----RE                 ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | namz :----                   North America | uk : United Kingdom | usa : United States | usdc : Washington DC | uss :----                   Southern U.S. | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries |----                   devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----                   Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD                Wires--------IPC                G/FDL--------PUB                Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN                 Document WSJO000020220425ei4p0002w------------------------CLM       Finance----SE        Markets----HD        Global Auditing Firms Struggle to Leave Russia; Some big consulting firms are out, but----          auditors face more complicated departures----BY        By Jean Eaglesham and Mark Maurer----WC        1,085 words----PD        25 April 2022----ET        15:00----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, global auditing and consulting firms promised to leave the----          country. For some, the departure is proving to be difficult and potentially embarrassing.--------          Big consulting firms such as Accenture PLC and McKinsey & Co. have quit or stopped all client work.----          But the Big Four accounting firms are still there, trying to unwind complicated relationships with their----          Russian counterparts.--------TD----          The protracted pullout puts Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers in the----          awkward position of condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine but still working for Russian----          companies, many of them state-owned.--------          It also could be embarrassing or worse. PwC Russia, for example, is offering businesses in Russia----          "decision-making support in turbulent times" that includes the option of making "imports via----          another…country," according to its website.--------          Rerouting imports might be a way to sidestep sanctions imposed by the U.S. and Europe, according----          to Charlie Steele, a former U.S. Treasury Department sanctions attorney.--------          "What they are suggesting certainly could be used as an avenue to try to evade sanctions," said Mr.----          Steele, a partner at consulting firm Forensic Risk Alliance. He added that the Russian accounting firm----          "might not have bad intent; they might think they are offering a lawful alternative."--------          A spokeswoman for PwC Russia declined to comment. A spokesman for PwC's international network----          said it "would be unacceptable for any member of the PwC Network to facilitate the violation of----          sanctions." PwC is "actively working on the separation" of the Russian firm from its network, the----          spokesman added.--------          The Big Four's long goodbye to Moscow also leaves them promising to abide by an array of sanctions----          against Russia, while operating in a country where those sanctions don't apply and could even be----          made illegal.--------          The Big Four's exits, once completed, will create stand-alone Russian firms built with international----          support and know-how. Those firms can now draw on that Western expertise in advising Russian----          companies on how best to minimize the impact of sanctions.--------          The Big Four will likely use these new firms for the now-complicated task of auditing the Russian----          operations of multinationals, according to people familiar with the matter. That could be one reason for----          the global firms to keep supporting their Russian counterparts, despite the separation.--------          Of the Big Four, Deloitte has the smallest Russian presence and appears closest to extricating itself----          from the country. It has removed much of its branding from its Russian business and aims to complete----          the separation early next month, according to a person close to the firm.------------          The other three remain in the throes of negotiations with their Russian firms, which still carry their----          brand, according to people familiar with the matter. The divorce process is proving complicated, the----          people said. EY expects it to take another five to eight months to complete, according to a person----          close to the firm.--------          Some of the consulting giants have gotten out faster. Accenture this month said it has completed the----          transfer of its Russian business to local leadership. The new firm has until May 9 to change its name,----          and until May 23 to finalize its rebranding, Accenture said.--------          Rival consulting firm McKinsey has "now ceased all client work in Russia," global managing partner----          Bob Sternfels said last week in a posting on social media.--------          Accounting firms might find it harder to make a clean exit because of the way their global networks----          are organized. Firms in each country are separately owned entities, bound by a legal agreement----          under which they pay a fee to share branding, technology and intellectual property.--------          Removing that shared support entirely could make it difficult for the Russian firms to offer their----          existing audit and other services, people close to the Big Four firms said. "The separation needs to----          happen in a way that those firms can continue to operate…the intention isn't to knife them," one of the----          people said.--------          SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS--------          What steps, if any, should the West take with companies that continue doing business in Russia? Join----          the conversation below.--------          EY's Russian firm has assured clients that it will still offer services based on standards developed by----          the global organization. EY "will continue to provide methodological support to [the] Russian practice,"----          the Russian firm said on its website. That could mean access to some resources of the global----          organization. A spokeswoman for EY's global network declined to comment.--------          One factor creating delays is the need to fulfill contractual obligations, such as completing or handing----          over audit and tax work in progress. There is also the logistics of disentangling the Big Four brand----          from Russia, both online and in paper-based documents.--------          Deloitte took down a page on its website after The Wall Street Journal asked why Russia was shown----          as part of the Deloitte Strategy consulting network. "It was simply an oversight, and we missed it when----          the relevant pages from our website were being removed," a Deloitte spokesman said.--------          The pullout isn't a big financial blow for the Big Four. The Russian firms represent less than 1% of the----          accounting giants' global revenues, according to people close to the Big Four. But the loss of the----          businesses, built up over decades, still hurts.--------          "It is like having to go home and shoot your own dog," one of the people said. "It is very painful, very----          emotional—[we] never expected this to happen."--------          The Russian accounting firms will likely pay more dearly for the split.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          WARSAW—Hundreds of Ukrainian students are enrolling in this city's public schools each day. Limits----          on classroom size have been raised. Some schools are running out of tables and chairs. To----          accommodate the roughly 100,000 refugee children currently living in Warsaw, local officials say they----          would need to build 2,000 new educational facilities.--------          "I don't think there's a town…in the world that would be able to admit 100,000 children in three or four----          weeks," said Renata Kaznowska, the deputy mayor of Warsaw. "It's simply impossible."--------TD----          Poland's public-school system is struggling to cope with the unprecedented influx of refugee children----          from Ukraine.--------          Around 200,000 refugees have enrolled in the country's public schools since Russia invaded Ukraine----          over eight weeks ago. An estimated half-million additional Ukrainian children are living in Poland but----          not yet enrolled.--------          As the conflict enters a new phase, with Russia pulling its forces out of central Ukraine to focus on the----          country's east, the number of Ukrainians fleeing the country has slowed. Those already outside of----          Ukraine have largely found beds in private homes, alleviating the burden on governments to provide----          housing.--------          But the demands on Polish schools are only beginning. In the early days of the war, many Ukrainian----          parents held their children out of the Polish school system, hoping they'd soon be able to return home.--------          Now, more refugees are beginning to see the war as a grinding conflict that won't come to any quick----          end and resigning themselves to longer-term stays in Poland and elsewhere. They are looking for----          jobs, finding their own apartments and, increasingly, signing their children up at Polish schools.--------          The influx of students is straining municipal budgets and making it next to impossible for districts to----          plan for next year, since they don't know how many Ukrainian students will be enrolled.--------          Warsaw is carrying the heaviest burden.--------          So far, the city has admitted around 17,000 Ukrainian students, Ms. Kaznowska said, but the pace has----          dramatically increased of late. Even before the war, she said, Warsaw's schools were short about----          2,000 teachers. She said the city was equipped to accommodate about 25,000 refugee students, and----          would hit that number within weeks.--------          "We will run out of capacity," she said. "These are huge numbers that we have to cope with."--------         The challenges are readily apparent at Juliana Ursyna Niemcewicza Primary School No 81, in----         southern Warsaw. Enrollment is up 10% since the war began. Most of the 40 new students speak little,----         if any, Polish.--------          For the first few weeks in Poland, Denys Andrianov didn't put his 11-year-old son into school. But after----          several weeks of staying with Mr. Andrianov's sister-in-law, the family is beginning to settle down in----          Poland. They moved into their own apartment; their son started at Juliana Ursyna Niemcewicza two----          weeks ago, and Mr. Andrianov, who was working on a ship in Saudi Arabia when the war broke out, is----          looking for work in Warsaw.--------          Every day his son says he wants to go home to Odessa. "We try to explain that it's not possible," said----          Mr. Andrianov.--------          In one sixth-grade Polish language class last week, eight of the 22 students were Ukrainian refugees.----          They sat in clusters of two or three, trying to follow along and using their phones to translate.--------          One of the Ukrainian children volunteered to read his composition to the class. It was in Ukrainian, and----          after he spoke, the teacher asked the children what they'd understood.--------          The Polish children picked out a few words they recognized: Chair, blue, colorful. The languages are----          linguistically similar.--------          "For a brief moment, we have felt what they feel when we speak Polish," said Ewa Cieśl, the teacher.--------          A Ukrainian teaching assistant, Zoriana Hrytsiuk, who was hired this month to help the 40 new----          students, looked on, but the help she could offer was limited. Like the students, she had fled to Poland----          when the war began, along with her son. Though she can speak Polish, she can't read or write much----          of it.--------          "I need to learn Polish better," she said. "Sometimes I can't translate everything."--------          Much of Ms. Hrytsiuk's job involves helping the new students deal with the emotional struggles of----          relocation and, often, separation from their fathers. One boy, she said, ran away from the school on----          one of his first days. Another drew a tank in art class. A third is constantly crying about his father,----          who's still in Ukraine. (Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 aren't allowed to leave the----          country.)--------          Elsewhere in Europe, schools haven't yet been much affected by refugee arrivals. Many parents are----          keeping their children in online classes run by the Ukrainian ministry of education rather than throwing----          them into classes in a new language.--------          But in Poland, which has taken in the majority of Ukrainians who have fled their country, the crunch in----          classrooms is now extending far beyond Warsaw.--------          Justyna Orłowska, an official with the Polish ministry of education, said the country has the space to----          accommodate all the Ukrainian students, but not if they all stay in major cities. She added that some----          students are likely to continue with online classes. "It is our moral duty to help," she said.--------          Hanna Koscielska, a teacher in Czerwonak County in western Poland, said her school has taken in 50----          children thus far. The county bought additional tables, chairs and textbooks to accommodate them.--------          The county has been unable to budget for next year, Ms. Koscielska said: "We have no idea how----          many students will be here in September."--------          At Witold Doroszewski Primary School in Nadarzyn, south of Warsaw, so many parents are coming in----          to enroll their children that the headmaster has set up chairs in the hall outside her office, so they can----          sit while they wait. School enrollment is up 10% from before the war, with 78 children having joined so----          far.--------          "An hour ago it was 78, but now I assume there's one or two more," the headmaster, Izabela----          Bogusiewicz, said. "It's changing basically every hour."--------          The reception from the community has largely been warm, she said. A Ukrainian student who moved----          to Poland three years ago has become an unofficial translator for the new children. Parents and----          teachers paid to buy supplies, like backpacks, for the Ukrainians.--------          But as the numbers have grown, Ms. Bogusiewicz said, so has unease among the Polish parents.--------          "In the beginning there was a lot of kindness and support, she said. "But then I have received single----          calls from parents complaining that the quality of teaching has worsened."--------          Eric Sylvers contributed to this article.------------          Write to Ian Lovett at ian.lovett@wsj.com--------          Scale of Refugees From Ukraine War on Display in Poland's Public Schools--------NS        gscho : School | gimm : Human Migration | gedu : Education | gpir : Politics/International Relations |----          gvio : Military Action | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News | gcns : National/Public Security |----          grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content Types----RE        pol : Poland | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eecz : European Union Countries |----          eurz : Europe | russ : Russia | uk : United Kingdom | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric :----          BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----          Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD       Wires--------IPC       N/CMR--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220425ei4p0015p------------------------CLM      Russia News----SE       World----HD       Russian Military's Next Front Line: Replacing Battlefield Equipment Destroyed in Ukraine;----         Moscow has lost thousands of big weapons to Kyiv's forces and faces Western sanctions----         designed to impede replacement, with two years of tank production erased----BY       By Daniel Michaels and Matthew Luxmoore----WC       1,692 words----PD       25 April 2022----ET       15:00----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         Russia's heavy use and loss of weapons in Ukraine, combined with severe Western sanctions, will----         crimp its military might and lucrative arms exports for years, hindering its ability to produce everything----         from new weapons systems to spare parts for existing armaments.--------         Now in the ninth week of what was envisioned as a quick military operation, Russia has deployed large----         parts of its arsenal, including some of its most modern equipment. It has fired vast numbers of missiles,----         rockets and artillery shells and cut deep into supplies of newer, precision munitions, say analysts.--------TD----         Russia has also lost more than 3,000 pieces of large equipment in battle, according to Oryx, an----         open-source intelligence tracker. The tally includes more than 500 main battle tanks, 300 armored----         fighting vehicles, 20 jet fighters and 30 helicopters.--------         Russia in recent years has produced around 250 tanks and 150 aircraft annually, according to Mark----         Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in----         Washington. That means Ukrainian forces in two months have destroyed the equivalent of at least two----         years of Russian tank production.--------         The U.S. believes Russia overall has lost roughly one-fourth of the combat force it initially had to----         invade Ukraine, a senior Pentagon official said last week, without providing details. The Russian----         Defense Ministry didn't respond to a request for comment.--------         For now, Russia's invasion forces can resupply from enormous equipment reserves, so the depletion is----         unlikely to affect the war's course quickly. Russia's official equipment rosters include tens of thousands----         of military land vehicles. But many require maintenance or repair, and a large portion are likely not----         operative and can be used only for spare parts, say analysts who track Russia's military. How many----         older vehicles can actually be deployed is unknown.--------         If the war drags on for months, consumption and destruction of Russian materiel, coupled with Western----         financial sanctions and export restrictions, will impede Moscow's capacity to provision forces with better----         equipment, analysts say. Russian defense contractors will similarly struggle to meet demand from both----         Moscow and export customers, or to invest in research and the development of new products, say----         Western officials and analysts.--------         "Our sanctions have pulled back the military-industrial complex of Russia, and it's not coming back any----         time soon," said U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman in Brussels on Thursday.--------         Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov said last month it was difficult to assess the impact of----         sanctions on Russia. "The goal of completing state orders was and remains a priority," he said.--------         The Kremlin hasn't confirmed the scale of equipment losses or how it plans to replenish its forces.----         Among the most significant losses it has confirmed is the sinking of the cruiser Moskva, the flagship of------------         its Black Sea Fleet, which Ukraine claims to have hit with missiles. Russia says it sank while being----         towed during a storm.--------         Russia, and previously the Soviet Union, built military strategies based on huge quantities of fairly----         basic weapons to overwhelm adversaries. Moscow at times has appeared ready to suffer big losses to----         achieve its goals, analysts say, relying on its stockpile of mostly Soviet-era weapons and many of the----         components needed to manufacture them. The approach contrasts with the West, which has focused----         on developing fewer but superior weapons that can better survive battle.--------         Replacing Russia's lost modern combat jets and helicopters would cost hundreds of millions of dollars,----         and Western sanctions are designed to impede resupply.--------         Even less-sophisticated land vehicles could pose a replacement challenge for Russian defense----         companies, which haven't extensively modernized production systems since Soviet times and still rely----         heavily on now-sanctioned foreign equipment, machine tools and precision components such as----         electronics and bearings. Russia's military-industrial sector has shrunk from its Soviet scale, further----         complicating a production surge like during World War II.--------         "We don't have the men, we don't have the equipment, we don't have the components," said a Russian----         military analyst.--------         While sanctions and industrial bottlenecks are unlikely to quickly affect battlefields in Ukraine, they----         could if the war grinds on.--------         "The real test for the industry regarding inputs probably will occur in the coming months or in next year"----         as stockpiles of components with sanctioned content get depleted and Russia runs low on----         foreign-made microchips now used in most military hardware, said Tomas Malmlof, a senior military----         analyst at the Swedish Defense Research Agency.--------         Defense-manufacturing problems that hit exports would weaken Russia's economy, which has been----         battered by the unprecedented sanctions. Russia is the world's second-largest weapons exporter----         behind the U.S., and arms are among Russia's largest exports aside from natural resources, which----         dominate the country's economy. Russia exports arms to over 45 countries and has accounted for----         around 20% of global arms sales since 2016.--------         Hurdles even impede Russian defense exports that don't rely on foreign inputs, due to sanctions----         imposed on Russia's banking system. State-owned arms manufacturer Almaz-Antey said last month it----         was unable to receive roughly $1 billion in payment from clients, including India and Egypt, and urged----         the Russian government to help military companies by developing systems to process foreign----         transactions.--------         "Right now, because of the imposed sanctions, the processing of payments has stalled," Almaz-Antey----         finance director Rustam Ulumbekov told Russia's TASS news agency. "And the sums are colossal."----         Almaz-Antey didn't respond to a request for comment.--------         In March, Russia's largest tank manufacturer, Uralvagonzavod, said it was furloughing some workers.----         A representative of its trade union said that the enterprise, which is under U.S. and European----         sanctions, was struggling with shortages of parts for components such as cartridge bearings, which it----         could no longer source from suppliers in Sweden and elsewhere because of sanctions.--------         "There's no problem with the number of orders. There are problems with their fulfillment," union official----         Aleksandr Ivanov told the news outlet Ura.ru.--------         Mr. Ivanov told The Wall Street Journal in a recent interview that Russia is now emphasizing----         import-substitution efforts that will allow it to replace even the scarcest parts.--------         "They'll find a way to fulfill defense contracts," he said. "This is a huge responsibility toward the state."--------         Component stockpiles offer a buffer, he said. "We have a strategic surplus, going back decades."--------         But analysts say Russia's newer, better military equipment could face more problems.--------         After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, Russia imported many Western weapons systems and----         components. In 2015, after the West imposed sanctions over Moscow's seizure of the Crimean----         Peninsula from Ukraine and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin launched a----         program to replace imports, ordering a renewal of its "military-industrial complex on a new----         technological basis." It said imports would be replaced in 826 types of weapons and military equipment----         by 2025.------------         Russian President Vladimir Putin at the time told his Military-Industrial Commission that "import----         substitution in the defense industry is a serious challenge that managers, engineers, designers,----         entrepreneurs and scientists must answer."--------         Since then, Russia has been unable to put into mass production some of its most advanced and highly----         touted new weapons systems, including Sukhoi jet fighters, the T-14 Armata tank and the A-100----         airborne early warning jet. Delays are due to production problems and sanctions, Russian media have----         reported.--------         SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS--------         Why do you think Russia's military has underperformed expectations? Join the conversation below.--------         Russia's battlefield performance, beyond depleting its armories, could hurt export sales. Ukrainian----         forces' large-scale destruction of Russian military equipment using modern Western-supplied drones,----         artillery and portable missile launchers undermines the reputation of Moscow's arms, said Scott----         Boston, a senior defense analyst at Rand Corp.--------         "When their weapons are being shown to be blown up all over the place, there's a general perception----         that maybe this equipment isn't that good," he said.--------         A hit to defense exports would hurt Russia beyond just denting its trade balance. Arms-exporting----         countries and companies rely on foreign sales to subsidize the development and production of new----         weapons systems for their home militaries. If Russian arms can't generate export revenue, Russian----         producers might struggle to innovate and remain competitive in the fast-modernizing sector.--------         "Russia is heavily dependent on exports to reduce their cost of weapons development," said John----         Parachini, a senior international and defense researcher at Rand.--------         Spare parts could pose another problem for Russia's military, since even noncombat military----         operations quickly wear through gear. Soviet industry focused on achieving production targets of----         finished products, from shoes to fighter planes, with less attention paid to ongoing support for the----         products. Post-Soviet Russia's defense industry has improved only slightly, say people who have----         worked with Russian factories.--------         For parts worn out in Ukraine, "being able to replace them is a protracted operation," said a former----         American military official with more than two decades of experience working with Russian military----         equipment, who didn't want to be identified. "They have never manufactured spare parts like we do."--------         A scramble for replacement parts could also hurt exports to Russia's top foreign buyers, including----         India, Vietnam and Egypt.--------         "If some of the biggest purchasers of weapons from Russia worry they can't get spares, they will----         develop their own indigenous systems…or shift to other countries," said Mr. Parachini at Rand.--------         Beneficiaries could be former Eastern Bloc countries that still have and support Soviet-designed----         equipment, Mr. Parachini said.--------         Robert Wall and Sharon Weinberger contributed to this article.--------         Write to Daniel Michaels at daniel.michaels@wsj.com and Matthew Luxmoore at----         Matthew.Luxmoore@wsj.com--------         Russian Military's Next Front Line: Replacing Battlefield Equipment Destroyed in Ukraine--------IN       iaer : Aerospace/Defense | iindstrls : Industrial Goods--------NS       gvio : Military Action | c13 : Regulation/Government Policy | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | e51 :----         Trade/External Payments | ecat : Economic News | gesanc : International Sanctions | gpir :----         Politics/International Relations | gtrade : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | ncolu : Columns | gcat :----         Political/General News | gweap : Weapons Programs | gcns : National/Public Security | gdef : Armed----         Forces | gdip : International Relations | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters |----         nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter----RE       russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | uk : United Kingdom----         | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----         Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD      Wires------------IPC      I/ARO--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220425ei4p000uq------------------------CLM      Finance----SE       Markets----HD       World's Best-Performing Stock Markets Are in the Middle East This Year; Region is now the----         world's one bright spot for listings in a market paralyzed by Ukraine war and concerns about----         global growth----BY       By Rory Jones in Dubai and Stephen Kalin in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia----WC       1,229 words----PD       25 April 2022----ET       16:30----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         Foreign investors are pouring money into a Persian Gulf stock-market boom, as energy-rich----         monarchies spin up their massive government entities into public companies and an oil-price rally fuels----         interest in the region.--------         Once home to national oil companies and sleepy family businesses, the region is now the world's one----         bright spot for initial public offerings in a listings market that elsewhere is paralyzed by the Ukraine war----         and concerns about global economic growth.--------TD----         The last time oil was above $100 a barrel in 2014, Saudi Arabia's stock market wasn't open to foreign----         buyers, few of the biggest companies or oil firms were listed and international investors largely ignored----         exchanges in the region. Now, $100-a-barrel oil has helped make the stock markets in Saudi Arabia----         and Abu Dhabi two of the best performers globally this year, both up more than 19%, according to----         FactSet.--------         More than $7 billion of foreign capital flowed into Middle East stocks in March, a record month,----         according to investment firm Franklin Templeton.--------         "The Middle East is in a sweet spot," said Dubai-based Rami Sidani, head of frontier markets at----         Schroders PLC. "We've got investors coming to the region seeking one of the best oil exposures in the----         emerging markets space."--------         So far this year, the Middle East was the only region world-wide to register an uptick in the value of----         public listings in the first quarter versus the same period last year, led by share sales in Saudi Arabia----         and the United Arab Emirates, according to research firm Dealogic.--------         Across 15 deals, companies raised nearly $10 billion from IPOs in the year to April 19, compared with----         $300 million in the same period last year, propelled by governments privatizing state-owned firms.----         Europe, by contrast, raised $3.7 billion so far this year.--------         This month, Dubai, the U.A.E.'s commercial hub, raised $6.1 billion by listing part of the emirate's water----         and electricity utility, the region's biggest IPO since oil giant Aramco sold $25.6 billion in shares in 2019.--------         The emirate's government had planned to list only 6% of the Dubai Water and Electricity Authority, or----         DEWA, but tripled the number of shares available after seeing global interest, including from U.S. asset----         managers BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group, as well as sovereign-wealth funds from Norway and----         Singapore, according to people familiar with the investors.--------         The boom isn't limited to the traditional energy and financial sectors. Among the recent Saudi listings----         are a pharmacy company, a food-delivery app and a firm that runs cold-storage warehouses.----         Real-estate development firms and water bottlers are expected to follow soon.----------------         Around the rest of the world, IPO activity has slumped or remained flat in the first three months of the----         year, according to Dealogic, with bankers citing the fallout from the Ukraine war, rising interest rates,----         and warnings of an impending world-wide recession.--------         Rising inflation, a drop in oil prices or a global economic downturn could dampen the good times in the----         Gulf market. National governments will retain control of many of the companies that are going public,----         curbing the influence of new shareholders and raising the possibility that companies will give priority to----         state policies over investors' interests. Some investors also remain wary of a region where high-profile----         corporate scandals, most notably at private-equity firm Abraaj Group and hospitals operator NMC----         Health PLC, burned foreign buyers.--------         Still, the Persian Gulf petrostates are some of the few short-term beneficiaries of a higher oil price,----         which coupled with regulatory changes designed to encourage companies to list is producing a----         coming-of-age moment, bankers and investors said.--------         "There's not much activity happening globally," said Samer Deghaili, head of capital markets for the----         region at HSBC PLC. "The Middle East is standing up."--------         Investors running funds dedicated to emerging markets are shifting capital to the Middle East from----         countries that were once magnets for investment but now face turmoil, bankers and investors said.----         Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused market-index compilers such as MSCI Inc. and FTSE Russell to----         withdraw it from their emerging-market trackers. A government crackdown on the technology sector----         has spooked investors in China, and the recent economic crisis in Turkey, another important emerging----         market, has made it a less attractive place to invest.--------         The Gulf is "increasingly perceived by investors as the only viable emerging-markets play," said Andrée----         Chakhtoura, head of investment banking in the region at Bank of America.--------         At the center of the region's emergence is government policy designed to strengthen financial----         exchanges and cash out stakes in state-owned companies. The U.A.E. and Saudi governments, in----         particular, have announced major economic overhauls and are investing IPO proceeds to jump-start----         non-oil sectors.--------         Competition, too, is playing a part: Riyadh, Dubai and Abu Dhabi are all pushing companies to list on----         exchanges in those cities, each fighting for global investor cash.--------         "It's healthy for investors. It provides a bigger universe, more investment opportunities in the Gulf," said----         Fadi Arbid, co-founder and chief investment officer of Riyadh- and Dubai-based alternative asset----         manager Amwal Capital Partners.--------         Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said he wants the country's exchange, the Tadawul,----         already by far the region's biggest with a market capitalization of more $3 trillion, to become one of the----         world's largest equities markets. His efforts to attract direct investment from foreign companies, which----         involves more exposure to local policies, have faced major obstacles.--------         The Saudi government is expected to sell more of Aramco on the local exchange, and the country's----         sovereign-wealth vehicle, Public Investment Fund, is encouraging companies in which it owns stakes to----         list. The latest example: Digital security firm Elm raised more than $800 million for PIF in February.--------         In total, the Saudi exchange has received applications for 50 IPOs in this year, though they are not all----         likely to list, according to Franklin Templeton.--------         "We have seen a bumper quarter in terms of issuance," said Salah Shamma, Franklin's head of----         equities in the region. "That's going to continue well into the end of the year."--------         The seeds of the current IPO boom were sown in 2015 when the Saudi kingdom opened its market to----         foreign investors and Prince Mohammed later said he would list part of Aramco.--------         A flood of money poured into Saudi Arabia in 2019 when MSCI and FTSE Russell added the country to----         their emerging-market indexes. The government then encouraged families and owners to list firms by----         offering incentives, such as preferential treatment on government contracts. Abu Dhabi and Dubai----         followed suit.--------         The result is that each market now has more listed companies and in a much wider spectrum of----         industries than before.--------         Write to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com and Stephen Kalin at stephen.kalin@wsj.com--------        World's Best-Performing Stock Markets Are in the Middle East This Year--------NS       c1711 : Initial Public Offerings | c02 : Corporate Changes | c14 : Stock Listings | c171 : Share Capital |----         ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | ncolu : Columns | npda : DJ Exclusive Analysis - All | c17 : Corporate----         Funding | cactio : Corporate Actions | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E----         Industry News Filter----RE       saarab : Saudi Arabia | uae : United Arab Emirates | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | eurz : Europe |----         meastz : Middle East | uk : United Kingdom | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz :----         Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | gulfstz : Persian Gulf Region | wasiaz :----         Western Asia | weurz : Western Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      0005.HK--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220425ei4p0015r------------------------CLM      Review & Outlook (U.S.)----SE       Opinion----HD       Where Are Germany's Weapons for Ukraine?

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised Germans and their allies a transformation in Berlin's----         approach to foreign and defense policy. As voters and North Atlantic Treaty partners try to assess----         whether he meant it, a question looms: Where are Germany's arms for Ukraine?--------         The snail-like pace of weapons shipments to Kyiv's military is becoming a political scandal in Germany.----         Berlin has improved on its laughable offer of 5,000 helmets, extended in mid-February before Vladimir----         Putin started his invasion. Germany has since shipped an assortment of anti-aircraft missiles,----         rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns, mines and the like.--------TD----         But Mr. Scholz is reluctant to send tanks, armored vehicles and other heavy equipment Ukraine needs----         to fight the prolonged campaign this war is becoming. The tabloid Bild reported last week that Mr.----         Scholz had excluded such weapons from a proposal for German manufacturers to ship new arms----         directly to Ukraine at Berlin's expense. Berlin has also refused to send older weapons.--------         Instead, Berlin belatedly struck a deal last week under which NATO ally Slovenia will supply Ukraine----         with Soviet-era T-72 tanks, which Germany will replace with more up-to-date equipment. Yet deliveries----         directly from Germany are still off the table.--------         Political expediency doesn't explain the foot-dragging, which is becoming a major controversy in Berlin.----         Leading members of the Green and Free Democratic parties, which govern in a coalition with Mr.----         Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), are vociferous advocates for heavy weapons. So are many----         members of the opposition Christian Democrats. The polls say sending heavy weapons to Ukraine also----         enjoys support with a German public shaken (for now) out of its traditional pacifism by Mr. Putin's----         invasion.--------         Ostensibly practical concerns also ring hollow. Mr. Scholz's administration says it worries that sending----         more of its heavy weapons would degrade Germany's military capacity. This might be true given----         Berlin's chronic underinvestment in its military over many years, but it's also irrelevant. Germany and----         its NATO allies aren't currently under threat of invasion as Ukraine is, retired Gen. Hans-Lothar----         Domröse told public broadcaster WDR Thursday. The weapons Berlin sends to Ukraine today could be----         replaced within months.--------         It's possible Mr. Scholz doesn't think Ukraine can win. That view in Washington explained early delays----         in support from the U.S., although the Biden Administration now appears to recognize a Russian----         victory—or ceasefire favorable to Russia—isn't certain.--------         No matter the reason, these delays are an embarrassment for a chancellor who promised more----         support for Ukraine and whose voters expect it. Mr. Scholz is undermining his credibility with NATO----         allies. Heavy-weapons shipments would send a strong deterrent signal to Mr. Putin that Germany's----         strategic transformation regarding Russia and his recommitment to NATO are serious. Mr. Scholz's----         new foreign policy starts with tanks for Ukraine.------------         Where Are Germany's Weapons for Ukraine?--------NS       gdip : International Relations | gvexe : Executive Branch | gcat : Political/General News | gpir :----         Politics/International Relations | gpol : Domestic Politics | gvio : Military Action | ncolu : Columns | nedc----         : Commentaries/Opinions | gweap : Weapons Programs | gcns : National/Public Security | gdef : Armed----         Forces | grisk : Risk News | gvbod : Government Bodies | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters |----         nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter----RE       gfr : Germany | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eecz : European Union Countries |----         eurz : Europe | russ : Russia | uk : United Kingdom | ussrz : CIS Countries | weurz : Western Europe |----         apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | dach : DACH Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----         Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe----IPD      Opinion |--------IPC      N/EEC--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220425ei4p0053e------------------------CLM      Politics and Policy----SE       Politics----HD       Pandemic Border Policy Could Complicate Covid Relief, Ukraine Bills; Congress returns to face----         two major funding requests from the Biden administration----BY       By Eliza Collins and Michelle Hackman----WC       1,183 words----PD       25 April 2022----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         WASHINGTON—When Congress returns this week, a pandemic-era immigration policy could----         complicate efforts to pass further coronavirus relief legislation and possibly another Ukraine aid----         measure if centrist Democrats side with Republicans in opposing the Biden administration's repeal of----         the border rules.--------         Earlier this month, the Biden administration said that in May it will end its use of Title 42, a----         controversial policy dating to the Trump administration that allows Border Patrol agents to quickly turn----         away migrants at the southern border.--------TD----         Liberal Democrats cheered the decision, but Republicans and some Democrats, particularly those in----         difficult re-elections, said the administration didn't have a detailed plan in place to deal with the----         expected increase in migrantsto the southern border at a time when migrants are already crossing----         illegally at the fastest pace in at least two decades. Privately, some said the move could flip some----         Democrats' seats to the GOP.--------         SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS--------         What is your outlook on the $10 billion Covid aid package? Join the conversation below.--------         Republicans are trying to amend a $10 billion coronavirus relief bill that is being considered in the----         Senate to reinstate the border policy. They are hoping enough Democrats will join them.--------         A request for additional aid to Ukraine could also become tied up if Democratic leaders decide to move----         that measure along with the Covid-19 aid package. President Biden said last week the administration----         would send a supplemental budget request for weapons and ammunition.--------         The White House hasn't yet offered specific details on its request, and congressional Democrats will----         decide this week how to proceed on that front. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) had----         previously said he would like to combine global vaccine funding with Ukraine aid but hasn't detailed----         what a larger request would include.--------         On its own, a new Ukraine bill would likely have broad bipartisan support. Sen. Jim Inhofe of----         Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Twitter that when----         Congress returns "we must immediately turn to writing an aggressive supplemental for Ukraine that----         responds to the military and humanitarian needs of the Ukrainian people."--------         Senators had hoped to move the coronavirus relief legislation earlier this month and send it to the----         House for final passage, but the bill was delayed over the efforts to amend it. The bill will need 60----         votes for passage in the 50-50 Senate, giving Republicans power in making demands.--------         Some Democrats said they would consider supporting the amendment, depending on how it was----         written. However, several Democrats said they didn't want to hold up the relief bill, which the White----         House considers an urgent priority, over the effort. One possibility Republicans are considering is------------          using the language from bipartisan legislation that would reinstate Title 42 until after the pandemic is----          declared over.--------          Ten Democrats joined Republican colleagues to introduce the immigration legislation in both the----          House and Senate before Congress broke for a two-week recess. Additional Democrats in both----          chambers have expressed concern about removing the border policy, and Republicans believe they----          could increase support for the bill.--------          The administration has previously said it expects that revoking Title 42 could lead to a marked rise in----          both the numbers of migrants seeking asylum at the border and those released into the U.S. to pursue----          their requests. But whether or not the policy comes to an end, intelligence reports tracking movement----          through Latin America indicate unprecedented numbers of people on the move, many of them headed----          for the U.S. border.--------          The administration has highlighted its early planning, saying it is pre-emptively strengthening----          government contracts for transportation and medical care and adding more staff to handle increased----          arrivals. Officials said they are preparing for a worst-case scenario that assumes an average of 18,000----          migrants will cross the border illegally a day—roughly triple the pace seen so far under the Biden----          administration.--------          "The assertion that we do not have plans is an assertion that is not grounded in fact," Department of----          Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CBS News on Friday. "We have been planning----          for months to address increases in migration; those that we already have experienced and those that----          we might experience upon an end to Title 42."--------          Still, Democratic aides in Congress say the administration hasn't offered basic details of its----          planning—such as how many officials it will need to help process migrants or how much food and----          medical supplies it expects to use.--------          Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.) and Elissa Slotkin (D., Mich.), two House members in competitive----          re-elections who previously worked in national security positions, sent a letter Tuesday to Biden----          administration officials urging them to keep Title 42 in place "until you have a plan in place to address----          the inevitable migration surge."--------          Mr. Mayorkas is testifying before three House committees this week on the administration's handling of----          the border.--------          White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday the administration would continue to make----          preparations for the policy to end on May 23, but she said it was up to Congress to make the decision.----          Ms. Psaki declined to say whether Mr. Biden would sign a bill authorizing the delay into law.--------          By law, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't need the consent of Congress to----          decide when to put in place or remove Title 42.--------          Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, who is leading GOP efforts to amend the coronavirus bill, told The----          Wall Street Journal he had been in touch with Democratic senators about Title 42 over the break.--------          Asked about Ms. Psaki's comments, Mr. Lankford said he was fine with Congress taking the lead on----          the issue. "They have the authorities to be able to make decisions on the border for border security.----          They're just choosing not to be able to use those authorities," he said of the administration.--------          Representatives for Mr. Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) didn't respond to----          requests for comment on next steps.--------          Meanwhile, 20 Republican state attorneys general have asked a federal judge in Louisiana to issue a----          temporary restraining order blocking the administration from ending Title 42.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         The first quarter will be a messy one for Europe's banks, but with the risk of an economic downturn----         rising things may only get messier.--------         In quarterly results this week, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse will likely paint a mixed----         overall picture of the European banking sector. While the Russian invasion of Ukraine put the brakes on----         the recent investment banking boom, it also brought market volatility, particularly in commodities and----         interest-rate expectations. That will have helped some traders boost their revenues, but also comes----         with potentially higher capital requirements and risks such as mark-to-market writedowns or----         counterparty losses.--------TD----         Another big item in the mix will be loan losses. Most lenders still have pandemic-related provisions they----         could reverse. However, many will also need to book impairments against their Russian business.----         Raiffeisen Bank and Unicredit have the largest total exposure, but many others are involved, including----         Deutsche Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, UBS and BNP Paribas. Credit Suisse announced a $212 million hit----         for Russian assets last week as part of a wider profit warning related to its own idiosyncratic legal----         problems.--------         It is hard for outsiders to estimate the financial impact of banks' winding down Russian exposure, which----         ranges across different asset classes. A case in point: Société Générale had about €18 billion,----         equivalent to $19.5 billion, in total Russian exposure but booked a writedown of €3.1 billion when it----         announced its exit. The process is complicated and will take time: "A bank is not a hot dog stand that----         can be closed down within a week," said Johann Strobl, Chief Executive of Raiffeisen Bank in an----         analyst call last month.--------         All the moving parts make for an unpredictable results season. What seems more certain is the----         darkening view from here. European Central Bank governor Christine Lagarde warned this month that----         the "downside risks to the growth outlook have increased substantially as a result of the war in----         Ukraine." The prospect of embargoes on Russian energy supplies has exacerbated tight commodity----         markets, pushing up oil and gas benchmarks. This has fueled wider cost inflation and intensified a----         cost-of-living squeeze in the region. Banks are among the first in line to feel the impact of such----         macroeconomic forces.--------         The ECB could be forced to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in raising interest rates, despite weaker----         growth prospects, potentially swamping the benefit of economic reopening after the pandemic. In a----         worst-case scenario, it could all add up to a double-dip downturn—an uncomfortable echo of when,----         earlier this century, the Eurozone crisis arrived just in time to overwhelm any prospect of a European----         recovery from the global financial crisis.--------         Some European lenders are less exposed to Europe: Barclays has a big U.S. credit business, UBS's----         clientele of global billionaires may float above the fray, and the prospects of HSBC and Standard------------         Chartered are more dependent on their sizable Hong Kong businesses. There was more dispersion----         than usual in the first-quarter results of U.S. banks, and the same may be true of European lenders.--------         One argument for owning European bank stocks right now is payouts: Capital buffers built up through----         the pandemic had many investors expecting big cash returns this year. What executives choose to say----         about dividends and buybacks will be an important test not just of those expectations, but also of how----         banks themselves see the outlook for economies overshadowed by war.--------         Write to Rochelle Toplensky at rochelle.toplensky@wsj.com--------         A Choppy First Quarter May Be as Good as It Gets for European Banks--------CO       barc : Barclays PLC--------IN       i81402 : Commercial Banking | i814 : Banking | i81501 : Credit Types/Services | i831 : Financial----         Investment Services | ibnk : Banking/Credit | ifinal : Financial Services | iinv : Investing/Securities | iibnk----         : Integrated Banks----NS       e1101 : Economic Growth/Recession | gvio : Military Action | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | e11 :----         Economic Performance/Indicators | ecat : Economic News | ncolu : Columns | npred : Economic----         Predictions/Forecasts | gcat : Political/General News | gcns : National/Public Security | grisk : Risk----         News | ncat : Content Types----RE       russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | eurz : Europe | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | uk : United Kingdom----         | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----         Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD      WSJ--------IPC      0005.HK--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220425ei4p00105------------------------CLM      Best Practices----SE       Advisor Center----HD       Ukraine War Has Increased Cyber Risks for Advisors.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         The Russia-Ukraine war has resulted in increased cybersecurity threats that directly impact financial----         advisors.--------         Cyber warfare has already led to an increase in hacking and the introduction of malware to systems of----         organizations beyond Ukraine and Russia.--------TD----         Advisors should be aware of these increased risks to their systems and harden their defenses. Knowing----         where they are vulnerable and what they need to do to protect themselves is a good place to start.--------         Russia has launched cyberattacks against Ukraine, and Ukraine in turn has unleashed its "volunteer IT----         army" to fight back. These skirmishes can result in collateral damage to organizations and individuals----         outside the immediate conflict zone because computer malware, like biological viruses, rarely remains----         confined to its intended target or space.--------         We have seen such cyber collateral damage before. In 2017 hackers thought to be affiliated with----         Russia targeted Ukrainian citizens, with malware known as NotPetya, that was tied to software----         Ukrainians are required to use to file their taxes. It spread to multiple corners of the world, affecting----         organizations as diverse as Maersk, Merck, FedEx, and Mondelez International.--------         There is legal risk for advisors in failing to take appropriate steps in light of a well-publicized threat such----         as that posed by the Ukraine War. Many laws and regulations require organizations that collect and----         store personal and financial information to secure that information. The standard of liability is failure to----         take reasonable steps to protect investor information, and "reasonable" is defined by the needs of the----         circumstances of the current cyber environment of elevated risk.--------         The FBI and CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency) issued ajoint warning at the start of the----         war about potential cyber collateral damage from the Ukraine conflict, and those warnings comprise----         important safeguards all advisors should take now.--------         These security steps, many of which advisors can implement themselves, should be documented so----         they can be presented to a regulator in the event of an investigation following an attack and data----         breach. Documentation of the following safeguards can reduce legal risk but also business risk that----         could arise from loss of the advisor's reputation and the loss of confidence of investors following a----         successful cyberattack:--------         * Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), in which login requires entry of a code sent to a----         smartphone) for access to all systems with investor information, including email. While no safeguard is----         a guarantee against attack, the presence of MFA may deter an attacker who would prefer an easier----         target.--------         * Conduct the next scheduled system scan and risk assessment now, with attempts by "white-hat" or----         "ethical" hackers to enter the system in the manner of a true attacker. These assessments and scans----         can reveal the presence of malware that may not yet have triggered data leakage.--------         * Similarly, anti-malware or antivirus software should be updated to scan regularly for malware and also----         should be updated to the most current version, as should the main operating system. Automatic security----         updates should be enabled.--------         * Train your workers on security awareness and, in particular, make sure they know to alert IT if they----         notice slow or unusual system behavior.--------         In this time of greatly enhanced risk to critical information, advisors should govern themselves by a----         slight modification of the message of a ubiquitous sign in the New York City subways: "If you see----         something, say something."--------         Kenneth N. Rashbaum is a partner at Barton LLP where he advises multinational corporations, financial----         services organizations, life sciences organizations, and other businesses that collect, use, and share----         electronic information in the areas of privacy and cybersecurity.

This collection of early----        20th-century artists known as the Odessan Parisians is being sold as a single group of 86 paintings and----        drawings.--------        Yakov Peremen collected and supported these artists "and created opportunities for them to thrive,"----        Bekkerman says. In 1919, when the White Army of Southern Russia invaded Odesa—which is today----        one of Ukraine's most populous cities—Peremen "packed up the collection and shipped it to Palestine,"----        she says. His foresight is how art historians know about artists such as Theophil Fraerman, Amshei----        Nurenberg, Isaac Malik, and Sigismund Olesevich, who were inspired by and sometimes worked----        alongside European artists of the day, including Henri Matisse, Edgar Degas, and Marc Chagall.--------        The selling exhibition also includes paintings by 20th century modernists born in Ukraine, including----        Maria Siniakova, David Burliuk, Alexandra Exter, Oleksandr Bohomazov, and Wladimir----        Baranoff-Rossiné, Christie's said.--------        Another 20 photographs and video works are by contemporary artists of the Ukrainian diaspora that----        were curated by Peter Doroshenko, the executive director of Dallas Contemporary who is stepping down----        in May. Artists include Boris Mikhailov, Anna Kulacheck, Yelena Yemchuk, and Ira Lupu.--------        A portion of the selling exhibition's proceeds will benefit the protection of "Ukraine's cultural heritage----        from further damage and lay the foundation for future recovery," Christie's said in a news release. Funds----        will also be sourced from of a significant percentage of proceeds by consignors and most of Christie's----        commission.--------        "Cultural preservation is a mission that's close to our heart, close to our mission, understanding its really----        culture that moves humanity forward," Bekkerman says. "Ukraine's cultural heritage is already severely----        damaged…They need immediate supplies to Ukraine as the churches, museums, and monuments are----        being greatly destroyed."--------        In New York, Christie's will offer 11 contemporary artworks during its May 13 contemporary day sale that----        have been donated by artists and their galleries to benefit Doctors Without Borders' Emergency Relief------------        Fund. Among the works in this "Artists for Humanity" grouping are two pencil-drawn caricatures of girls----        by Yoshitomo Nara, with estimates ranging between US$80,000 and US$150,000, and a series of works----        by Mikhailov, the photographer, called "Yesterday's Sandwich," depicting life in the Soviet Union in the----        1970s.--------        Doroshenko also supported curation of these works, saying in a statement that he reached out to artists----        who he knew well and worked with in the past.--------        "All were deeply upset with the current war in Ukraine and wanted to help anyway they could,"----        Doroshenko said. "For the artists who moved to other countries from Ukraine, it was especially difficult,----        yet everyone located an art work for this important cause."--------        The May 13 day sales will also include works by artists Kenny Scharf and Gina Beavers to raise funds----        for Community Organized Relief Effort, or CORE, a global nonprofit crisis relief group founded by Sean----        Penn and Ann Lee.--------        Scharf's Frackattack, 2017, is estimated to sell for between US$100,000 and US$150,000 and Beavers'----        Invisible Lip, is estimated to sell for between US$40,000 and US$60,000.--------        The sales come after Christie's immediate response to the crisis in the form of donations to the Red----        Cross and the United Nations Refugee Agency, which are both providing humanitarian support to----        Ukrainians. The amounts of these donations weren't specified.--------        "This has definitely been a passion project for all of us, and we feel incredibly lucky to use our platform----        for this," Bekkerman says.--------        Christie's Raises Funds for Ukraine Through Sales in London and New York--------CO      chrs : Christie's International Plc | artmfs : Artemis SA | fpinau : Financiere Pinault SCA--------IN      i64 : Retail/Wholesale | i654 : Specialty Retailing | iretail : Retail | iahou : Auction Houses--------NS      gart : Art | gcltre : Cultural Heritage | gvio : Military Action | c151 : Earnings | c1513 : Sales Figures | ccat----        : Corporate/Industrial News | gartau : Art Collecting/Sales | gcha : Charities/Philanthropy | gent :----        Arts/Entertainment | nblog : Blogs | nrvw : Reviews | gcat : Political/General News | c15 : Financial----        Performance | gcns : National/Public Security | gcom : Society/Community | grisk : Risk News | ncat :----        Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfce : C&E Exclusion Filter | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter----RE      ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eland : England | eurz : Europe |----        london : London (UK) | namz : North America | uk : United Kingdom | usa : United States | use :----        Northeast U.S. | usny : New York State | ussrz : CIS Countries | weurz : Western Europe | hyogo :----        Kansai | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz :----        Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | jap : Japan----IPD     Barrons--------IPC     ART.YY--------PUB     Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN      Document WCBBE00020220425ei4p0002t------------------------CLM      WSJ Podcast Minute Briefing----HD       U.S. Says Its Diplomats Will Return to Ukraine--------WC       378 words----PD       25 April 2022----ET       15:33----SN       WSJ Podcasts----SC       WSJPOD----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

What to Know About Ukraine's President; The former actor and----        comedian now leads his country's resistance to Russia's invasion, remaining in Ukraine and----        determined to fight----BY      By James Hookway----WC      2,448 words----PD      25 April 2022----ET      14:46----SN      The Wall Street Journal Online----SC      WSJO----LA      English----CY      Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----        President Volodymyr Zelensky has become the face of Ukraine's resistance against Russian President----        Vladimir Putin's invading forces, with impassioned speeches such as an address to the United Nations----        Security Council in which he accused Russian forces of committing war crimes.--------        Mr. Zelensky came into power with little traditional political experience. Before he was elected, he was----        best known for playing a television role as an ordinary schoolteacher accidentally catapulted into power.----        The show, "Servant of the People," ran for four years, making him a household name.--------TD----        Since the Russian strikes began on Feb. 24, Mr. Zelensky has captured the world's imagination, often----        dressing in military T-shirts or ballistic vests as he urges people to press the fight during videos he posts----        to Telegram, Facebook and Instagram from the center of Kyiv. On April 18, he posted another video----        address where he warned that Russian forces had begun a fresh offensive in eastern Ukraine. At other----        times, the 44-year-old has harangued Western leaders to step up efforts to defeat Mr. Putin. Frustrated----        with the West's unwillingness to intervene militarily, Mr. Zelensky has repeatedly pressed the North----        Atlantic Treaty Organization to enforce a "no fly" zone over Ukraine, an idea NATO has rejected, saying----        it would put the alliance into a war with Russia. He has repeatedly called on Western nations to provide----        Ukraine with artillery, ammunition, air defense systems and jet fighters to repel Russian forces, or he----        warned, Poland, Romania, Moldova and the Baltic states could be next.--------        "The Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning, then they want to capture other----        countries," he said in a late-night address on April 23.--------        Mr. Zelensky says he knows he is at the head of the Kremlin's kill-or-capture list, but he insists that----        neither he nor his family will leave as he tries to keep his battered country together.--------        Where is Zelensky now?--------        Mr. Zelensky has met with a number of world leaders who cameto Kyiv after Russian forces pivoted to----        consolidate their positions toward the east of the country. Those arriving included U.S. Secretary of----        StateAntony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, European Commission President Ursula von----        der Leyen, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and----        Estonia. Mr. Zelensky's exact location is a security matter. In an ABC interview, he said he had been----        offered safe passage out of the country if the situation further deteriorated, but he said he would remain.--------        Mr. Zelensky on April 4 visited the town of Bucha near Kyiv, where he said there was evidence that more----        than 300 civilians had been killed or tortured in the area, and that more atrocities could be uncovered as----        Russian forces retreated to eastern Ukraine. The following day he spoke by video to the U.N. Security----        Council in New York, where he cataloged an avalanche of alleged abuses.--------        "There is not a single crime that they would not commit there," Mr. Zelensky said to the Security Council.----        "Some of them were shot on the streets, others were thrown into wells, so they died there in suffering."--------        "Civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road," Mr. Zelensky said.----        "Women were raped and killed in front of their children."--------        Russia has denied the allegations, saying photographs and videos showing dead civilians had been----        fabricated.--------        How long has Zelensky been president of Ukraine?--------        Mr. Zelensky was elected president in 2019, defeating the incumbent Petro Poroshenko by casting----        himself as an antiestablishment outsider bent on rooting out corruption and securing better relations with----        Moscow. His pitch was largely based on the role he played on his TV show, where he portrayed an----        ordinary man thrown into the presidency to clean up the country. His political party was even named----        after the show.--------        How is Zelenskywinning international support?--------        Mr. Zelensky is at the apex of a sophisticated public relations effort to build global backing for Ukraine.----        From hand-shot videos from the streets of Kyiv to his addresses to the United Nations and the U.S.----        Congress, Mr. Zelensky is careful to tailor his message for his specific audience. He invoked the attacks----        of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor for American lawmakers and referred to Britain standing alone against Nazi----        Germany as he spoke by videolink to the British parliament. When speaking to the Irish parliament, he----        referred to the danger of famine in other parts of the world because of the disruption to Ukraine's huge----        agricultural exports. He told the Grammy Awards that Ukraine's cities were being silenced by the----        Russian war machine.--------        In Ukraine, his customary late-night addresses over social media have become a rally-point for ordinary----        Ukrainians. Sat at his desk, Mr. Zelensky provides updates on how the conflict is progressing,----        applauding the sacrifices of the Ukrainian armed forces and warning of the tests to come.--------        How has Zelensky handled the invasion?--------        Early on, Mr. Zelensky directed much of his energy toward projecting a sense of calm as Russian forces----        steadily built up along Ukraine's borders to eventually total as many as 190,000 troops. He said U.S.----        warnings of an imminent invasion were overblown and were damaging Ukraine's economy. Mr. Zelensky----        pointed to an even larger Russian buildup last spring that was eventually withdrawn.--------        But after the first Russian strikes began to hit Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities on Feb. 24, he pivoted hard----        toward shoring up Ukraine's defense, securing as much Western assistance as he could obtain. With----        Russian propaganda claiming he had already fled the country, he made a hand-shot video of himself out----        on the street in front of the presidential palace in Kyiv to urge on Ukrainians in their defense of the----        country. It drew millions of views on Telegram and Facebook. Gone were the suits and ties, in came----        military sweatshirts.--------        Mr. Zelensky spoke frequently with Western leaders, urging them to increase sanctions on Moscow in----        the hope of breaking the Russian advance. As he pleaded with European leaders in a video call to take----        tougher action, he warned them that this might be the last time they saw him alive, according to several----        diplomats.--------        "The silence in the room was impressive," a senior European Union official said. Shortly after, the----        27-nation bloc moved to significantly expand the range of measures as the West hardened its response----        to Moscow's aggression.--------        Mr. Zelensky has since been on a virtual tour of capitals to rally support for Ukraine. In addition to the----        U.N. and the U.S. Congress, he has addressed people in the U.K., Germany and Switzerland, among----        others, with plans for further outreach to seek assistance and keep international pressure on Russia. So----        far he hasn't succeeded in persuading the West to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine.--------        He is also pushing Western nations to do more to tighten sanctions, including an embargo on oil sales to----        the EU. On April 21 he suggested to a meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund that----        a new global tax be imposed on any transactions with Russia to help pay for the rebuilding of Ukraine,----        which has seen more than 1,000 schools and universities destroyed or damaged in addition to other----        infrastructure losses.--------        Mr. Zelensky said Ukraine needs $7 billion every month until the summer to keep functioning. World----        Bank President David Malpass said the Russian operation has caused at least $60 billion in damage to----        Ukraine's infrastructure.--------        How has Zelensky's stance against Russia evolved?------------        Mr. Zelensky initially sought a rapprochement with Russia when he was elected president in 2019.----        Ukraine had been at loggerheads with the Kremlin since 2014, when Russian forces annexed the Black----        Sea port of Crimea and stirred up a rebellion that led to two pro-Russian regions breaking away from----        Kyiv's control. Mr. Zelensky pledged to improve relations with Mr. Putin, and had some early successes.----        He secured a prisoner exchange with Russia and moved toward a deal on how to build on a 2015----        cease-fire agreement.--------        Street protests against his plans forced him to change tack. Western diplomats warned him that Mr.----        Putin was trying to get him to sign an agreement that would provide Mr. Putin with long-term influence----        over Ukraine's future via Russia's proxies in the breakaway regions, with the goal of barring the country----        from joining the EU or NATO.--------        Mr. Zelensky instead turned toward persuading NATO to engage in a closer relationship with Ukraine----        while launching a popular campaign to win back control of the strategic Crimean Peninsula. A person----        close to him said Russia had begun to see him as being too similar to Mr. Poroshenko, whom he----        succeeded as president, and as someone intent on pushing Ukraine closer to the West.--------        Political analysts said the prospect of Ukraine aligning itself more closely with the West had enraged Mr.----        Putin, who has long been trying to restore Russia's sphere of influence, which had been curtailed----        severely since the end of the Cold War more than 30 years earlier.--------        On the fifth day of the invasion, Mr. Zelensky said the Ukrainian people were now fighting to become----        equal members of the EU—with many paying the ultimate price. "We are giving our lives for the right to----        be equal," he said, unshaven and wearing a green army T-shirt. "Prove that you are with us and won't let----        us go."--------        How did Zelensky rise from television comedian to president?--------        Mr. Zelensky studied law at university but after graduating entered the entertainment business, founding----        a television-production company. He became famous for his skits, including one where he and some----        accomplices dropped their trousers and pretended to play a piano with something other than their hands.----        Later, he won the Ukrainian version of "Dancing with the Stars" in 2006 and voiced the role of----        Paddington in the eponymous movie about a young bear who visits London.--------        It was his TV show "Servant of the People" that captured the mood of the country when the program first----        aired in 2015, however. Mr. Zelensky played a humble schoolteacher who candidly ranted on a video----        about the everyday corruption many Ukrainians need to contend with. The clip went viral, launching a----        political career that ultimately propelled his character into the presidential palace.--------        The success of the show convinced Mr. Zelensky that he should try his hand at politics for real. His----        campaign echoed many of the themes he explored in the TV show and his political party carried the----        same name, "Servant of the People." He won the second-round runoff against the incumbent, Mr.----        Poroshenko, with about 73% of the vote.--------        What is Zelensky's family background?--------        Born on Jan. 25, 1978, Mr. Zelensky grew up in a gritty, Russian-speaking region in southeast Ukraine.----        His background was Jewish; several family members died in the Holocaust while his grandfather served----        in World War II as an officer in the Soviet army. His father, a mathematician, and his mother, an----        engineer, chose to stay in Ukraine while many other Jews departed for the U.S. or Israel when the----        former Soviet Union permitted them to emigrate. Childhood friends recall how he stood out for his----        earring and his good grades in school. He later obtained a law degree at Kyiv National Economic----        University.--------        Mr. Zelensky himself has made little of his Jewish identity, saying in 2020 that he came from an ordinary----        Soviet Jewish family and that most such families weren't religious. This appears to ignore how Jews in----        the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine, largely had to suppress their religious identity and were----        viewed as outsiders. Some commentators have suggested this has informed Mr. Zelensky's own----        self-image as an outsider, reflected in both his TV work and his presidential campaign in 2019.--------        Ukrainians appear more favorably disposed toward Jews than do the people of other countries that were----        in the Soviet bloc. A Pew Research Center poll in 2019 found that 5% of Ukrainians were unwilling to----        accept Jewish people as fellow citizens, compared with 18% in Poland, 19% of Czechs and 22% in----        Romania. Ukraine's prime minister when Mr. Zelensky became president, Volodymyr Groysman, is also----        Jewish.--------        When Mr. Putin said Russia's invasion was designed to "denazify" Ukraine's leadership—a potent slur in----        Russia, referring to World War II—Mr. Zelensky was quick to ridicule the Russian leader's claims.--------        What is Zelensky's connection to Roman Abramovich?--------        When U.S. officials were drafting a list of Russian oligarchs to sanction in response to the invasion, the----        White House's National Security Council told the Treasury to leave off one of the best-known names:----        Roman Abramovich. According to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Zelensky had advised President----        Biden in a phone call that Mr. Abramovich could serve an important role as go-between to secure a----        peace agreement. The U.K. and the EU both sanctioned Mr. Abramovich over his links to Mr. Putin,----        freezing his assets in their jurisdictions. His London soccer club, Chelsea FC, is now for sale.--------        A billionaire former oil magnate and Kremlin insider for more than two decades, Mr. Abramovich is the----        only oligarch to publicly say he is trying to push Moscow to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.--------        What happened between Zelensky and Donald Trump?--------        Shortly after becoming Ukraine's president, Mr. Zelensky was thrust into the center of U.S. politics after----        President Donald Trump was accused of pressuring him in a telephone call to investigate his chief rival----        at the time, Joe Biden. An impeachment resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives alleged that Mr.----        Trump had made the provision of $391 million in U.S. security aid contingent on Mr. Zelensky's publicly----        announcing a probe. After Mr. Trump's actions came to light, the resolution charges, he released the aid,----        which was meant to strengthen Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country.--------        Mr. Trump rejected allegations of wrongdoing and, while he was impeached in the House, he was----        acquitted by the Senate.--------        This explanatory article may be periodically updated.--------        Write to James Hookway at James.Hookway@wsj.com--------        Who Is Volodymyr Zelensky?

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          SOUTHEAST POLAND -- The U.S. will return an embassy presence to Ukraine and increase military----          support for the country, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told----          Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a meeting in Kyiv, as Russia's war shifts gears in----          eastern and southern Ukraine.--------          Sunday's visit was the highest-level U.S. delegation to go to Ukraine since the start of the war on Feb.----          24 and follows similar trips from other countries' leaders and diplomats, as Washington and its allies----          increase efforts to show support for Kyiv and help the country defend itself.--------TD----          After pulling out earlier this year, U.S. diplomats will return to Ukraine this week, initially with day trips----          to the western city of Lviv with the goal of returning to a functioning embassy in Kyiv in the near future,----          a senior State Department official said. On Monday, President Biden is expected to nominate Bridget----          Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as the next ambassador to Ukraine, the official said.--------          Meanwhile, the U.S. will provide Ukraine with $322 million in foreign military assistance to allow Kyiv----          to buy needed weapons, part of a total package of $713 million in U.S. military assistance for more----          than a dozen countries in the region, U.S. officials said ahead of a briefing in Poland with Messrs.----          Blinken and Austin.--------          The new funding comes after two previous military-aid packages of $800 million each for Ukraine that----          included heavy artillery, armored personnel carriers and helicopters.--------          The visit from Messrs. Blinken and Austin came as Orthodox Christians, the largest religious group in----          Russia and Ukraine, celebrated Easter two months into the war.--------          Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, had appealed for a four-day truce----          during the Orthodox Holy Week to allow for the evacuation of civilians from front-line towns and the----          delivery of humanitarian aid.--------          The cease-fire proposal was rejected by Moscow, which said it was a ruse to allow Ukraine's military----          to rest and regroup. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the U.N., Dmitry Polyanskiy,----          told a Security Council session on Ukraine last week that a pause in hostilities would give Ukrainian----          forces time to receive new shipments of drones, antitank guided missiles and man-portable----          air-defense systems.--------          Mr. Guterres is due to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow this week before----          traveling to Kyiv. At a press conference on Saturday, Mr. Zelensky criticized Mr. Guterres's decision to----          visit Russia first. "The war is in Ukraine, there are no bodies in the streets of Moscow," he said.--------          On Sunday, Mr. Zelensky, who is Jewish, posted a video message from Kyiv's Saint-Sophia Cathedral----          on the Telegram social-media platform, saying Ukraine on Easter asks "God for great grace to make----          our great dream come true -- this is another great day -- the day when great peace will come to----          Ukraine."--------------------          After rapid initial gains by Russian forces, the Ukraine conflict has settled into grinding war, with----          Russia making incremental gains in the south and east of the country, where it is concentrating its----          firepower after pulling back from Kyiv and other northern regions.--------          Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday it had destroyed a gunpowder-and-explosives factory in----          Pavlohrad, a city near the eastern Donbas area where Russian troops are focusing their offensive, as----          well as four weapons depots in the northern Kharkiv region.--------          Ukraine's southern operational command said on Sunday its forces had recaptured eight settlements----          in the southern region of Kherson, most of which is occupied by Moscow. Russian advances on the----          towns of Oleksandrivka, Tavri and Mykolaivka were also beaten back by Ukrainian artillery, it said in a----          statement.--------          There was no independent confirmation of the claims by either side.--------          The two U.S. cabinet members' trip to Kyiv on Sunday to meet Mr. Zelensky, follows visits from other----          countries' leaders. Mr. Biden hasn't visited Ukraine during his presidency, and the White House has----          said there are no plans for a visit. The State Department official said Mr. Biden speaks regularly with----          Mr. Zelensky and that the U.S. president's travel requirements are unique, in part due to security----          considerations.--------          After meeting Mr. Zelensky, Messrs. Blinken and Austin were expected to brief reporters Monday at a----          facility in Poland near the border with Ukraine.--------          Senior military officers there described an accelerating logistical network for supplying weapons and----          materiel to Ukraine, as well a regional effort to increase troop levels and exercises with members of----          the North Atlantic Treaty Organization along the alliance's eastern flank.--------          Seven 155-mm artillery pieces, along with their tow vehicles, are being processed through the facility,----          adding to the 18 howitzers the U.S. has already provided to Ukraine, a senior defense official said.

Soldiers----          stationed there and in smaller outposts up and down the street guarded it fiercely, turning the leafy----          road that translates as Apple Street into the scene of some of the grisliest killings of Ukrainians that----          have come to light since the start of the conflict.--------          The nondescript four-story office building on the town's southernmost stretch was one of the first sites----          where Ukrainians were questioned, tortured, killed or detained, according to Bucha residents and local----          officials.--------          Nearly 100 soldiers were housed at 144 Yablunska Street, along with radio-electronic equipment used----          to control operations in Bucha and the nearby towns of Irpin and Hostomel, said Ukrainian officials.--------          More than 30 Russian military units came through Bucha, mostly from Russia's Far East and Siberia,----          including the 14th Separate Special Forces Brigade from Khabarovsk, the 38th Separate Motorized----          Rifle Brigade and paratroopers from Pskov, in western Russia.--------          Bucha Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk said the Russians divided the city into several zones and worked----          through a list of some 40 names of local politicians and state officials who lived in each zone,----          detaining and killing those they found.--------          He said he saw his name was at the bottom of the first of two pagesof names not listed in alphabetical----          order. The mayor managed to evade the Russians. Russian troops shot and killed the mayor of----          neighboring Hostomel as he was handing out aid to residents.--------          When Mykola Zakharchenko, who worked as a security guard on the grounds of 144 Yablunska Street----          before the Russians arrived, was detained March 4 with another man, the grounds of the building----          were strewn with dead bodies. The two were led with their hands in the air to a side yard where the----          bodies of seven men who had been shot were lying face down in pools of blood.--------          The Russian troops told them to look at the bodies, get on their knees and confess to being members----          of the Ukrainian resistance.--------          Mr. Zakharchenko said he wasn't fighting and handed over his phone, a late-model iPhone his son----          had given him, so that the Russian soldiers could check the contacts and photographs. He watched a----          Russian soldierdownload the contents of his phone onto a computer and then look up his domestic----          identity number. The Russian officer asked him about time he had spent in the Russian city of Tula as----          a welder in 2018.------------          "We've seen your proletariat past," said the officer, who was wearing paratrooper gear according to----          Mr. Zakharchenko. "Get inside."--------          For the next four days, Mr. Zakharchenko lived in the headquarters' basement, a Soviet-era bomb----          shelter turned underground prison, with some 130 other people. They were given leftover food and----          military meals for days as the men, women and children struggled to find space to sleep.--------          Over the next weeks, the Yablunska Street headquarters became chaotic. Blood from those shot and----          dragged from room to room stained the floors. Trash piled in the hallways, and bottles of beer and----          wine littered the floor. Human excrement piled up in buckets and on the floor.--------          There was similar violence at other Russian bases on Yablunska Street and nearby. Russian soldiers----          took over one yellow, two-story house with an adjoining garage, where neighbors said people were----          led and shot.--------          Northwest of 144 Yablunska Street, Russian troops holed up in buildings a few streets away from one----          another, one at 7 Ostrovsky Street and another at 104 Vokzalna Street, close to the site where----          Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian armored column the day Russia rolled into town.--------          One Bucha resident who said she was inside theOstrovsky address described the soldiers who stayed----          there. "They drank there," she said. "They had fun there. They were having a party."--------          She said many of the soldiers at the Ostrovsky building were young and frightened, brought to tears----          by the strain of the war.--------          "They wanted their mother," she said. "They didn't want to fight." She added that they said they were----          forced to kill people.--------          Russian troops took over a children's camp, digging trenches at its entrance. When the Russians left,----          local residents found five people there with their hands tied. They had been shot in the back of the----          head. Radio equipment and documents were left in another makeshift base.--------          After the city descended into panic during the Russian troops' occupation, the town woke up one----          morning to find them gone.--------          "We were living in bomb shelters the whole time, we had no idea they had left until the shooting----          stopped," said Lidia, a cleaner at a church across the street from the children's camp.--------          Some of the Russian soldiers who were in Bucha returned home to awards. The 64th Separate----          Motorized Rifle Brigade, one of the units that occupied Bucha, received one of the military's highest----          honors from Russian President Vladimir Putin following their withdrawal, turning it into an elite Guards----          Brigade.--------          "Putin knew about the atrocities his soldiers committed here and all he could say was 'good job,' " said----          Mr. Fedoruk, the mayor.--------          Moscow has denied targeting civilians in its military assault on Ukraine and called video and----          photographic images from Bucha staged.--------          -----------          Brett Forrest contributed to this article.--------          License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------NS        gdef : Armed Forces | gvio : Military Action | gcat : Political/General News | gcns : National/Public----          Security | grisk : Risk News----RE        ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----          Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe | ussrz :----          CIS Countries----IPC       IGV--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document J000000020220425ei4p0001d------------------------HD          The Ukraine Crisis: Easter Brings Prayers for War's End--------BY          By Thomas Grove----WC          567 words----PD          25 April 2022----SN          The Wall Street Journal----SC          J----PG          A7----LA          English----CY          Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Soldiers on leave mixed with local residents of the capital city, which the----            Russians tried and failed to take in the first weeks of the war.--------TD----            Some said they were praying for more heavy weapons from the U.S. and its Western allies, echoing----            an appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has called for more help in defending----            against a Russian assault in the country's east and south.--------            "We all pray that the Lord would help each of us achieve victory over the aggressor," said Father----            Feodosiy, 32 years old, who blessed baskets of Easter eggs and cakes laid out by the faithful in the----            courtyard of the monastery. "And for a quick victory, we need weapons."--------            "We ask God for great grace to make our great dream come true -- this is another great day -- the----            day when great peace will come to Ukraine," said Mr. Zelensky, who is Jewish, in a video message----            posted Sunday from Kyiv's Saint-Sophia Cathedral.--------            About two-thirds of Ukrainians are Orthodox, while about 10% of the population is Greek Catholic.----            The Russian Orthodox Church dominated Ukraine for centuries and claims Ukraine as part of its----            canonical territory.--------            However, Kyiv pushed for independence following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea in Ukraine's----            south and Moscow's support for separatists in the country's east.--------            In 2019, Ukraine won its own Orthodox Church, making it independent from the Moscow----            Patriarchate, which previously had authority over the Orthodox Church in Ukraine.--------            The Russian Orthodox Church has long been seen as a tool wielded by the Kremlin to gain political----            and cultural influence and help forge an ideology that supports Russian President Vladimir Putin's----            geopolitical aims.--------            During the war, critics have accused the Russian Orthodox Church -- by far the biggest of the----            Eastern Orthodox churches -- for promoting the Kremlin's view of the conflict.--------            Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, has described the war in Ukraine----            as a struggle between good and evil, with the outcome deciding "where humanity will end up, on----            which side of God the Savior."--------            St. Michael's became the headquarters of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine in 2019.It became a----            symbol of Ukrainian resistance after its priests gave shelter in 2013 to pro-Western protesters.--------            Those demonstrations ultimately snowballed into the deadly street fighting that ousted the leader----            the next year and turned the country away from Russia and firmly toward the West.----------------            Today, the church displays photos of Ukrainian soldiers who have died in the conflict in the----            country's east since 2014.--------            On Sunday, Chaplain Father Dmytro, dressed in olive-green robes, led a group of some 25----            conscripts with worn camouflage uniforms and shaven heads through the throngs of churchgoers to----            deliver a short service for them inside the cathedral's frescoed and golden interior.--------            "We are on our God-given land," he said.

Then, two days----         later, it reopened its confectionery plant in Lviv and its condiments factory in the northwestern Volyn----         region to continue supplying the country with needed food.--------         To protect factory staff from the threat of airstrikes, the owner of KitKat chocolate and Nescafe coffee----         has turned underground rooms into bomb shelters and shut off the elevators.--------         It has also adjusted production lines to allow for frequent stops and starts, and reduced the number of----         staff on site at any one time to ensure everyone can fit in the shelters.--------         Both Lviv and the Volyn region have suffered air attacks recently. "Less than an hour ago I heard sirens----         saying an attack can come from the air," Volodymyr Spivak said in an interview this month.--------         Mr. Spivak, Nestle's corporate affairs director for Ukraine and Moldova, has relocated from Kyiv to Lviv,----         where he has helped direct the company's relief efforts.--------         Nestle is among several food makers, including General Mills Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc., that have----         been sending food donations to Ukraine. Meanwhile, companies ranging from German auto supplier----         Leoni AG to tech company Fractal Analytics Inc. have made changes aimed at protecting their staff in----         the country.--------         Nestle -- which employs more than 5,000 workers in Ukraine -- has had to contend with almost a third----         of its staff relocating during the conflict, as well as disruption to its supply chains.--------         Since the war began, the company has been trying to rejigger the way it works in Ukraine while----         simultaneously grappling with employee discontent over its initial decision to keep selling the majority of----         its locally made products in Russia, along with some imports. Nestle along with other companies has----         been criticized by Ukrainian politicians and consumers. The company recently said it would narrow----         sales in Russia to essentials like baby food and medical nutrition products, halting sales of other----         products like mainstream pet food, coffee and confectionery.--------         Russia makes up about 2% of Nestle's global sales, while Ukraine makes up less than 1%, a----         spokesman said.--------         Nestle's instant-noodles factory in Kharkiv, one of Ukraine's most heavily bombed cities, remains----         closed but has become part of the company's humanitarian efforts.------------------------         The company's line workers, loaders, engineers and other staff have been entering the facility ------         accompanied by armed guards provided by the national police and city territorial defense -- to pack----         boxes of noodles for local residents, including those sheltering in metro stations.--------         "It's a dramatically difficult situation because even during the day it was not possible to go just to the----         shop for bread, because it's 40 kilometers from the Russian border," Mr. Spivak said.--------         License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------CO       nstlc : Nestlé S.A.--------IN       iconf : Chocolate/Confectionery | ifood : Food Products | i41 : Food/Beverages | i421 : Sugar Products |----         icnp : Consumer Goods----NS       c24 : Capacity/Facilities | cscm : Supply Chain | neqac : Equities Asset Class News | c42 :----         Labor/Personnel | ccpgvn : Corporate Governance | ccsr : Corporate Social Responsibility | c41 :----         Management | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | cesg : Environmental/Social/Governance | ncat :----         Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter | nfcpin : C&E Industry----         News Filter----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----         Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe | ussrz :----         CIS Countries----IPC      ABO--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document J000000020220425ei4p0000z------------------------HD        The Ukraine Crisis: Moscow Hides Data On Economy--------BY        By Georgi Kantchev----WC        428 words----PD        25 April 2022----SN        The Wall Street Journal----SC        J----PG        A7----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The central bank limited the volume of financial information that local banks have to----          publish regularly while lawmakers are working on a bill banning lenders from sharing data with foreign----          states.--------TD----          The growing blackout is part of an effort by Russian authorities to protect the economy and domestic----          companies from further sanctions by the West following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.--------          Limited data means Washington and Brussels will have less visibility on whether and how their----          sanctions are biting into the Russian economy, making it more challenging to find new targets and----          fine-tune future sanctions rounds.--------          "They are trying to obscure the economic picture," said Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the----          Institute of International Finance. "We have bans on Russian media and now the same goes for----          statistics access. The Iron Curtain is coming up from both sides."--------          The sanctions have cut off Moscow from much of the Western financial infrastructure.

The full scale of the harm to the environment is difficult to assess because inspectors lack----         access to many regions of the country, she said.--------         Contamination sites are also being identified by nongovernmental organizations, including PAX, a----         Dutch nonprofit that documented pollution in Syria and other conflict zones; the Conflict and----         Environment Observatory, a U.K. charity; and Ecoaction, a Ukraine-based environmental group. By----         combing through witness posts on social media and messaging platforms such as Telegram, and----         cross-referencing those with satellite images and Google Earth maps, the groups have each----         documented damage at more than 100 sites, ranging from power plants to military installations and----         water-treatment plants.--------         "What we're seeing is really a kind of crowdsourced environmental detective work," Mr. Smith said.--------         Many contaminated sites have been identified near the cities of Kyiv, Luhansk and Kharkiv, said----         Evgenia Zasiadko, head of the climate department at Ecoaction.--------         As fighting intensifies in the eastern part of the country, a heavily industrialized corridor with chemical----         factories, coal mines and refineries could come under fire.--------         Damage to coal mines in the region could poison the groundwater that small villages in the area rely on----         for drinking water. "There is a major risk for local people and for longer environmental impacts if military----         activities happen there," Ms. Stavchuk said.--------         In other parts of Ukraine, public-health experts expressed concern over the release from industrial sites----         of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium -- which are linked to developmental delays in children ------         into the air and drinking water. "In the midst of a war, it's hard to quantitate the exposure" to----         environmental pollutants, said Barry Levy, an adjunct professor of public health at Tufts University----         School of Medicine and an expert on the effects of war on public health.--------         After missile debris damaged fertilizer tanks in the Ternopil region, east of Lviv, river-water samples----         downstream showed ammonia levels 163 times above normal and nitrates 50 times as high, according----         to Ms. Stavchuk.--------         Across Ukraine, hundreds of enormous reservoirs store about 6 billion tons of liquid waste from mining----         and industrial activity, according to a 2019 report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in----         Europe. Those toxic chemicals could spill into nearby land or rivers if the reservoirs were damaged.--------         The conflict has knocked out more than a dozen water facilities, including water-treatment plants and----         dams, said Wim Zwijnenburg, project leader of PAX's effort to monitor environmental damage sites in----         Ukraine. Damage to water-treatment plants has left untreated wastewater to wash into rivers or----         streams.--------         Air pollution is another major concern, said Neta Crawford, a professor of political science at Boston----         University and co-director of the Costs of War Project at Brown University. Depending on how long the----         war lasts, emissions from tanks, military aircraft and trucks could amount to "as much as a small or----         medium-sized country in an entire year," she said.--------         Russian strikes have targeted fuel depots and refineries across Ukraine, prompting large fires and the----         release of pollutants including soot, methane and carbon dioxide.--------         Previous conflicts suggest that those emissions can have long-distance impacts.--------         License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------IN       i17 : Water Utilities | iutil : Utilities--------NS       gqual : Environmental Pollution | gdip : International Relations | genv : Natural Environment | gairp : Air----         Pollution | gasbst : Environmental Health | ghea : Health | gvio : Military Action | gcat : Political/General----         News | gcns : National/Public Security | gpir : Politics/International Relations | grisk : Risk News----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz : Europe--------IPC      IGV--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document J000000020220425ei4p0000w------------------------HD        The Ukraine Crisis: World Confronts Economic Cost of War --- Kyiv needs $5 billion a month in----          support for up to five months, and $600 billion to rebuild----BY        By Yuka Hayashi----WC        461 words----PD        25 April 2022----SN        The Wall Street Journal----SC        J----PG        A6----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

"Everyone is thinking----          about something like a Marshall Plan for Ukraine, like what happened after World War II," she said,----          referring to the U.S.-led multinational reconstruction program launched in 1948 that helped revive----          Europe's economy through official aid and private investments.--------          The task comes at a challenging time for the world economy. Nations including the U.S. are grappling----          with their own problems, including soaring inflation and slowing growth. Many developing countries ------          facing higher food and fuel prices and ballooning debt burdens in the midst of rising interest rates and----          a continuing pandemic -- say they need help from rich governments and international financial----          institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank.--------          "The big issue everybody is grappling with is. . .how do you do policy-making in this world when you----          have a crisis upon a crisis and you haven't recovered from the first crisis yet," Gita Gopinath, first----          deputy managing director at the IMF, said.--------          Nonmilitary support for Ukraine and developing-country debt stress were top topics for finance----          ministers and central bankers attending the meetings.--------          Ukraine's financial needs, according to officials from Kyiv and the multilateral groups, fall into two main----          categories: short term and long term.--------          The country needs roughly $5 billion every month to cover essential government services over the----          next two to three months, according to the IMF's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, referring to a----          budgetary shortfall resulting from a drop in revenue and increased costs such as caring for wounded----          soldiers and displaced citizens.--------          Mr. Shmyhal said about $600 billion would be needed for the costs of recovery, reconstruction and----          transformation of Ukraine's economy.--------          License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service--------------------CO        eubrd : European Bank for Reconstruction and Development | imonf : International Monetary Fund |----          twban : The World Bank----NS        gvexe : Executive Branch | csched : Announcements of News Conferences/Calls | gvio : Military Action----          | gcat : Political/General News | gcns : National/Public Security | gpir : Politics/International Relations |----          gpol : Domestic Politics | grisk : Risk News | gvbod : Government Bodies | ncat : Content Types |----          npress : Press Releases----RE        ukrn : Ukraine | usa : United States | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe----          | eurz : Europe | namz : North America----IPC       IGV--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document J000000020220425ei4p0000q------------------------CLM     Other Voices----HD      Why Didn't Markets Make Russia Peaceful?--------BY      By Christopher Smart----WC      945 words----PD      25 April 2022----SN      Barron's----SC      B----PG      70----LA      English----CY      Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----        About the author: Christopher Smart is chief global strategist and head of the Barings Investment----        Institute.--------        It's humbling when lifelong assumptions crumble, but there are lessons amid the debris. At least that's----        my hope as I brace for the next gruesome phase of the Ukraine war and watch the world's 11th-largest----        economy shrink before my eyes. Most markets may be back where they were before the war began, but----        the world certainly isn't. It's important to understand why.--------TD----        I studied Russian in college because it seemed important to understand America's principal Cold War----        adversary. When the Soviet Union collapsed, I packed off to Moscow to help advise a group of harried----        reformers on how best to drive the market transition. Later, as a portfolio manager, the underlying----        premise was that investing in Russia delivered good returns and also reinforced progress on political----        reform and economic integration.--------        Bolstering the country's stake in the global economy, the simple logic went, raised the chances of----        political cooperation and peace. It's a premise of much Western diplomacy that now deserves yet----        another look.--------        I was not so naïve as to believe that an "end of history" signaled a new era of interstate comity, but the----        idea that economic engagement encourages good behavior made sense. As an emerging Russian----        middle class saw the benefits of German capital equipment, holidays in Turkey, and steadily rising living----        standards, they would want to encourage their country's deeper involvement with the outside world.----        Sure, we would still snarl at one another over NATO enlargement or Middle East conflicts, but the basic----        alignment of economic interests would keep the relationship on the rails.--------        It's a contentious idea in academia. "Realists" insist that international relations are best understood as----        strong states imposing their will on the weak. Indeed, this school claims vindication in the tragic scenes----        unfolding in Ukraine. There is an attractive simplicity to the logic that in the wake of Soviet collapse, the----        West overreached and failed to gain Moscow's trust.--------        But the notion that free-market democracies don't go to war with one another dates back to philosophers----        like Immanuel Kant and Joseph Schumpeter. This was essentially the heart of Western policy toward----        post-Soviet Russia. There was a scramble to get Boris Yeltsin invited to the prestigious G7 meetings in----        the 1990s even if he had little to say on exchange rates. There were legions of foreign advisers like me----        whose governments financed projects to help privatize state assets, write new corporate laws, and----        launch retail mutual funds. One key element of the strategy was to secure Russian membership in the----        World Trade Organization in 2012. Trade figures confirm that Russia's dependence on global commerce----        grew rapidly following the Soviet Union's collapse.--------        Over that time, the points of friction (Serbia, Syria, Iraq, Snowden, Magnitsky, Navalny, and----        cyberattacks) quickly overwhelmed any fragile grounds for cooperation (tentative foreign investment,----        Afghanistan, and space).--------------------        By 2015, after Russia had seized the Donbas and Crimea, I worked at the National Security Council as----        part of a team that began to deliberately dismantle the economic relationship, imposing sanctions,----        discouraging corporate investment, and cutting off areas of cooperation. The current breathtaking wave----        of sanctions has delivered the final blow to this badly frayed economic relationship.--------        If this feels like dramatic failure for one grand experiment, though, perhaps it can launch a re-thinking of----        modern economic diplomacy.--------        First, it's important to analyze why we failed. It could be the realists are right that national security----        concerns were always going to dominate. Or maybe Russia is just the exception that proves the rule.----        Free-market democracies may in fact be more peaceable, but the Putin regime is not much of either.----        Had we done more to invest in political and economic transition, would the world be here today?--------        Second, we may need to re-evaluate how we balance economic engagement with political or security----        concerns. Trade and financial flows are at the heart of the European Union's success. But we have----        applied a similar "integration" strategy to China, only to see that relationship go sour. India is very much----        a free market and a democracy, yet it remains one of the U.S.'s more difficult partners on key foreign----        policy issues--including current Russia sanctions.--------        Third, at least with regard to Russia, we're in a new phase of our economic diplomacy, now reliant on----        sticks for results where carrots failed. Extreme sanctions have yet to produce results in Iran, but they did----        ultimately contribute to democratization and international integration for post-apartheid South Africa. The----        punishment being inflicted will tip the Russian economy into depression, sending it back into 1970s-era----        isolation. Some measures may be relaxed amid bargaining for a cease-fire in Ukraine, but the real logic----        at this stage is to create enough suffering to encourage regime change. This may come quickly—or----        never.--------        As historians explore these questions and others, maybe the immediate lesson is simply that positive----        economic engagement is necessary to secure cooperative behavior from another country, but it's hardly----        sufficient. That may not sound like much, but starting to reframe a central premise in Western policy may----        be the best we can do for now as we pick up the pieces from our prior assumptions about Russia.--------        Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's and MarketWatch----        newsroom.

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         Nestlé SA is rejiggering its operations and supply chain to keep factories running in Ukraine, while----         ramping up efforts to get food donations to the hardest hit parts of the country.--------         After Russia invaded in February, many big multinationals suspended operations in Ukraine, citing----         concerns about employee safety, labor shortages and the difficulty of getting raw materials into the----         country.--------TD----         Nestlé initially closed all three of its factories in Ukraine following the outbreak of war. Then, two days----         later, it reopened its confectionery plant in Lviv and its condiments factory in the northwestern Volyn----         region to continue supplying the country with needed food.--------         To protect factory staff from the continuing threat of airstrikes, the owner of KitKat chocolate and----         Nescafe coffee has turned underground rooms into bomb shelters and shut off the elevators. It has also----         adjusted production lines to allow for frequent stops and starts, and reduced the number of staff on site----         at any one time to ensure everyone can fit in the shelters.--------         Both Lviv and the Volyn region have suffered air attacks recently. "Less than an hour ago I heard sirens----         saying an attack can come from the air," Volodymyr Spivak said in an interview earlier this month. Mr.----         Spivak, Nestlé's corporate affairs director for Ukraine and Moldova, has relocated from Kyiv to Lviv,----         where he has helped direct the company's relief efforts.--------         Nestlé is among several food makers, including General Mills Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc., that have----         been sending food donations to Ukraine. Meanwhile, companies ranging from German auto supplier----         Leoni AG to tech company Fractal Analytics Inc. have made changes aimed at protecting their staff in----         the country.--------         Nestlé—which employs more than 5,000 workers in Ukraine—has had to contend with almost a third of----         its staff relocating during the conflict, as well as disruption to its supply chains. For instance, tomatoes----         once sourced from Ukraine to make sauces are now imported from Italy and Portugal.--------         Since the war began, the company has been trying to rejigger the way it works in Ukraine while----         simultaneously grappling with employee discontent over its initial decision to keep selling the majority of----         its locally-made products in Russia, along with some imports. Nestlé along with other companies has----         been criticized by Ukrainian politicians and consumers. The company recently said it would narrow----         sales in Russia to essentials like baby food and medical nutrition products, halting sales of other----         products like mainstream pet food, coffee and confectionery.--------         Russia makes up about 2% of Nestlé's global sales, while Ukraine makes up less than 1%, according----         to a spokesman.--------         Nestlé's instant-noodles factory in Kharkiv, one of Ukraine's most heavily bombed cities, remains----         closed but has become part of the company's humanitarian efforts.------------         The company's line workers, loaders, engineers and other staff have been entering the----         facility—accompanied by armed guards provided by the national police and city territorial defense—to----         pack boxes of noodles for local residents, including those sheltering in metro stations.--------         "It's a dramatically difficult situation because even during the day it was not possible to go just to the----         shop for bread, because it's 40 kilometers from the Russian border," Mr. Spivak said.--------         Nestlé has imported other products like baby food, soup meals, water and medical-nutrition products----         from its factories elsewhere in Europe to donate to Ukrainians. Trucks come in via Ukraine's border----         with Poland from countries like Germany and the U.K., and supplies then get dispersed around the----         country.--------         Ukraine's government has been leaning on companies to import more food into the country after----         Russia bombed depots, stores and warehouses while destroying packaging and bottling factories.----         Poland's government has told food companies that it believes Ukraine needs almost 10,000 tons of----         food daily from abroad, according to a briefing document. Nestlé says it has donated 2,080 tons of----         bottled water, baby food, instant noodles, coffee and other products so far and has been working to----         increase imports for donation from 10 to 25 trucks a week.--------         Since the outbreak of war, Nestlé has deployed a playbook it developed during Covid-19 lockdowns to----         get food donations to those in need, working with food banks, nonprofits and local officials.--------         To coordinate its donation efforts, a team of about 20 Nestlé staff across functions like logistics,----         corporate communications, operations and sales join an hour-long call every morning.--------         Aside from its three factories, Ukraine is home to a business center in Lviv that supports accounting,----         payroll and social-media functions for Nestlé offices in over 70 countries.--------         Some staff from Nestlé's Lviv hub are now manning an internal hotline that is open from 9 a.m. to 8----         p.m. that employees can call to ask questions about relocating or where they can receive medical----         treatment.--------         Nestlé said about 30% of its staff in Ukraine have moved, mainly from the east to the west, with some----         going abroad. To help workers, the company has rolled out a wartime employee support plan that----         includes paying salaries in advance, offering one-off relocation payments and healthcare services.--------         For workers leaving Ukraine, Nestlé has transformed part of a baby food factory in Poland into a----         temporary shelter where they can shower, rest and eat before moving on to more permanent dwellings.----         Rooms once used for meetings now house folding beds, while a fridge and microwave have been----         placed in a conference room to allow families to heat up food and assemble simple meals. About 1,000----         staff and family members have passed through the site, most staying for a single night or a few hours,----         the company said.--------         Write to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com--------         Nestlé Rejiggers Operations to Keep Supplying Food in Ukraine--------CO       nstlc : Nestlé S.A.--------IN       i41 : Food/Beverages | icnp : Consumer Goods | ifood : Food Products | iconf :----         Chocolate/Confectionery | i421 : Sugar Products----NS       c24 : Capacity/Facilities | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | cscm : Supply Chain | gcha :----         Charities/Philanthropy | gvio : Military Action | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News | gfod :----         Food/Drink | gcns : National/Public Security | gcom : Society/Community | glife : Living/Lifestyle | grisk :----         Risk News | ncat : Content Types----RE       ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | uk : United Kingdom----         | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----         Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      GIS--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220424ei4o0005o--------------------CLM      Economy Week Ahead----SE       Economy----HD       Economy Week Ahead: Economic Growth, Inflation in Focus; GDP reports to show how----         economies performed amid inflation, Russia's attack on Ukraine----BY       By WSJ staff----WC       431 words----PD       25 April 2022----ET       00:30----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The headline figure, which is adjusted for inflation,----         will likely reflect surging prices, a growing trade imbalance and slower inventory growth, masking----         relative strength in consumer spending, business investment and real estate.--------         FRIDAY--------         Figures to be released by the European Union's statistics agency are expected to signal a darkening----         outlook for the eurozone economy following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with growth weakening again----         in the first quarter, and the annual rate of inflation remaining high in April. Economists expect the----         inflation rate to hit a record of 7.5%, up from 7.4% in March.--------         U.S. consumer spending slowed sharply in February as households saw wage gains eroded by rising----         inflation. Economists forecast a pickup in outlays for March as Covid-19 continued to recede and----         consumers spent more on services like air travel and dining out. The Federal Reserve's preferred----         measure of inflation, due out alongside consumer spending figures, could show underlying price----         pressures, while easing, are still near a four-decade high.--------         The U.S. employment-cost index—a measure of wages and benefits paid by employers—for the first----         quarter is expected to show another stretch of strong wage gains, providing the Fed with more----         evidence that a tight labor market is contributing to the 40-year high for inflation.--------         Economy Week Ahead: Economic Growth, Inflation in Focus--------NS       ecat : Economic News | gsars : Novel Coronaviruses | e1101 : Economic Growth/Recession | gout :----         Outbreaks/Epidemics | e11 : Economic Performance/Indicators | ghea : Health | ncolu : Columns |--------          npred : Economic Predictions/Forecasts | e1103 : Inflation Figures/Price Indices | gcat :----          Political/General News | gcold : Respiratory Tract Diseases | gmed : Medical Conditions | gspox :----          Infectious Diseases | ncat : Content Types----RE        ukrn : Ukraine | russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | namz : North----          America | uk : United Kingdom | usa : United States | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric :----          BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz :----          Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD       Wires--------IPC       G/FED--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220424ei4o0025t------------------------CLM                      Infogrfx Slide Show----SE                       Interactives----HD                       Celebrating Orthodox Easter in Ukraine; Orthodox Christians, the largest----                         religious group in Russia and Ukraine, celebrated the holiday as Russian forces----                         built up for an offensive----WC                       170 words----PD                       25 April 2022----ET                       00:03----SN                       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC                       WSJO----LA                       English----CY                       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.--------CX----        Corrections & Amplifications--------        The Soviet Union dissolved in late 1991. A Review essay on Saturday about Western sanctions against----        Russia incorrectly referred to it ending two decades ago.--------        (WSJ April 28, 2022)--------        (END)--------LP----        Western sanctions against Russia have been sweeping and unrelenting since the country began waging----        war against Ukraine two months ago. Russia's central bank reserves are mostly frozen. The country's----        oligarchs are scrambling to secure their offshore wealth. Western capital effectively can't be invested in----        Russia any longer, and the makers of high-tech components have all but stopped exporting them there.----        Most Russian banks are now disconnected (or soon will be) from the Swift financial messaging network.----        More than 400 Western companies have left the country. Russia's coal is under embargo, and pressure----        is building to extend the ban to oil and gas.--------TD----        In Warsaw last month, President Joe Biden declared that "these economic sanctions are a new kind of----        economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that rivals military might." Initially, many anticipated----        that such devastating economic pressure would force the Kremlin to break off its invasion. Some even----        hoped that sanctions would spark internal unrest that would undermine Mr. Putin's regime. But while----        Russia's growth prospects are now extremely dire, the sanctions' ultimate outcome has proven as----        difficult to predict as that of the war itself.--------        For several decades Western elites have viewed sanctions as an easy substitute for military conflict. In----        the aftermath of the Cold War, it was widely expected that countries would become more peaceful as----        they joined the global capitalist order. Economic sanctions offered a convenient way to contain rogue----        states at low cost and acceptable risk. As a result, the use of sanctions surged between the 1990s and----        the 2010s. Occasionally the U.S. still resorted to putting boots on the ground, but Washington punished----        most autocratic regimes, from North Korea to Sudan and from Belarus to Cuba, by putting them under----        economic quarantine and forgetting about them.--------        Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exposed the flaws in this approach. The Russian Federation is not a----        hermit kingdom but a G-20 economy. For the two decades since the end of the U.S.S.R., it has pursued----        integration into world markets. The West imposed sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but----        these did little to lessen Russian military might. Nor did the threat of sanctions in the months before the----        war avert Mr. Putin's invasion on Feb. 24.--------        Sanctions have historically worked better against small states than large ones. In the 1920s, the threat----        of sanctions quickly and effectively deterred such states as Yugoslavia and Greece from undesired----        actions. But arrayed against larger powers, such as fascist Italy or imperial Japan, economic pressure----        tended to become a weapon of attrition rather than deterrence. A big economy will virtually always take------------        months, if not longer, to really feel the deprivation that sanctions cause. If the goal is to quickly cripple----        the war-fighting power of Russia, a resource-rich, hostile nuclear power with a large army, then----        sanctions are of limited use.--------        European leaders are belatedly recognizing that economic pressure alone is incapable of ending a war----        on this scale. Luxembourg's foreign minister Jean Asselborn noted last week that European leaders had----        to decide between "sanctions or weapons." He added, "My conclusion -- and if you had told me this two----        months ago, I would have said, 'Are you crazy?' -- is that it's now weapons." Indeed, sanctions merely----        complement the fierce resistance being put up by the Ukrainian army, equipped by growing quantities of----        NATO materiel.--------        The U.S. and Europe have shown remarkable unity in adopting the current sanctions regime. President----        Ronald Reagan's efforts to levy sanctions against the U.S.S.R., Libya and Nicaragua in the 1980s were----        more contentious, encountering resistance from German chancellors and British Prime Minister----        Margaret Thatcher. European leaders successfully pushed the Reagan administration to roll back----        sanctions that would keep European firms from constructing gas pipelines from Siberia. The relevance----        of this older pipeline dispute to the recent Nord Stream 2 saga was not lost on Secretary of State Antony----        Blinken, who once wrote a book on this forgotten crisis of the Atlantic alliance.--------        Maintaining sanctions on a country the size of Russia will require the U.S. to manage not only its NATO----        allies but also non-Western ones. Altogether, 37 advanced economies have coordinated the campaign----        to isolate Russia. This group controls about 55% of world GDP. But much of the international community----        remains outside that coalition.--------        Many Latin American, African and Asian countries are reluctant to join the sanctions in part because----        they depend on Russian commodities and raw materials. Most developing economies can ill afford to----        stop buying Russian wheat, corn, oil, copper, nickel, aluminum and nuclear technology without alternate----        sources of supply. If the West is to persuade or coerce more than half of the world's population in the----        global South out of trade with Russia, it will have to help them cushion the shock of switching away from----        Russian commodities, or else face a future of global inflation, debt crises and regional recessions.--------        When the time comes for peace negotiations, the sanctions will furnish a useful tool. A negotiated----        settlement might seem implausible right now, but history shows that the war aims of belligerents can----        and do change over time, especially in prolonged conflicts. In the event of real talks, the staged lifting of----        sanctions could be tied to Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory.--------        Western negotiators could make similar use of frozen assets. So far, the U.S., U.K., EU and Swiss----        governments have frozen roughly $400 billion in Russian central bank assets and at least $240 billion in----        private wealth. The West has thereby gained a considerable prize, but it has also suffered serious----        financial losses because of the sanctions. At the end of 2020, Russia's stock of foreign direct investment----        stood at $446 billion. Much of that money has been lost as Western firms have fled the country. Portfolio----        investments worth another $120 billion have become irretrievable or at risk of default. Mr. Putin could----        nationalize the remaining Western business assets, much as the Bolsheviks decided in 1918 to----        abrogate all debt obligations and property rights of Western investors.--------        The expropriations of the 2020s, like those of the 1910s, will shape Western relations with Moscow for----        years to come. But should future political change in Moscow allow for a rapprochement, Western----        powers will need not only to reconstruct Ukraine but also to help rebuild a Russian economy shattered----        by sanctions. The interwar recriminations that followed the Russian Revolution and the Treaty of----        Versailles are a reminder that justice for the victims of aggression must be combined with generous----        provisions that mend international relations and foster economic stability.--------        The economic sanctions against Russia have opened a new battlefield: currency markets, strategic----        technologies, corporate supply chains and foreign assets. But the technical ingenuity of the new----        generation of sanctions cannot answer important questions of politics and strategy. We don't know what----        victory in this economic war would look like or whether it can yield a geopolitical solution that is stable----        and durable. Could a nuclear power whose economy and institutions are wrecked by sanctions----        transition to democracy without external aid? Sanctions alone don't hold the answers. For that, the West----        will need positive economic measures and farseeing diplomacy.--------        -----------        Mr. Mulder is assistant professor of history at Cornell University and the author of "The Economic----        Weapon: The Rise of Sanctions as a Tool of Modern War," published earlier this year by Yale University----        Press.--------        License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service------------CO      rosgos : Central Bank of the Russian Federation--------NS      gdip : International Relations | gvexe : Executive Branch | gcat : Political/General News | gesanc :----        International Sanctions | gtrade : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | gvio : Military Action | ncor : Corrections |----        ncrx : Corrected Items | e51 : Trade/External Payments | ecat : Economic News | gcns : National/Public----        Security | gpir : Politics/International Relations | gpol : Domestic Politics | grisk : Risk News | gvbod :----        Government Bodies | ncat : Content Types----RE      russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | usa : United States | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz :----        Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | eurz :----        Europe | namz : North America | ussrz : CIS Countries----IPC     IGV--------PUB     Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN      Document J000000020220423ei4n0000k------------------------CLM      Economy----SE       Economy----HD       Ukraine's Grim Economic Toll From War Confronts World Governments; Kyiv says it needs----         around $5 billion a month in budgetary support for up to five months and $600 billion for----         broader rebuilding effort----BY       By Yuka Hayashi----WC       1,154 words----PD       24 April 2022----ET       00:50----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         WASHINGTON—Top world financial officials gathered in Washington this past week confronted a grim----         picture of the growing economic costs of Russia's war in Ukraine and the challenges they face to help----         pay Ukraine's short- and long-term bills.--------         Ukraine needs around $5 billion a month in budgetary support for up to five months and roughly $600----         billion for a broader rebuilding effort, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Thursday at a----         forum hosted by the World Bank during spring meetings held with the International Monetary Fund.--------TD----         The two international financial institutions and several individual governments have started pledging----         contributions, but in interviews and public comments, officials acknowledged that much work lies ahead----         to come up with the funds needed.--------         "You will now see a big mobilization of the international community," said Odile Renaud-Basso,----         president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in an interview Friday.----         "Everyone is thinking about something like a Marshall Plan for Ukraine, like what happened after World----         War II," she said, referring to the U.S.-led multinational reconstruction program launched in 1948 that----         helped to revive Europe's economy through official aid and private investments.--------         The task comes at a challenging time for the world economy. Nations including the U.S. are grappling----         with their own problems, including soaring inflation and slowing growth. Many developing----         countries—facing higher food and fuel prices and ballooning debt burdens in the midst of rising interest----         rates and a continuing pandemic—say they need help from rich governments and international----         financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank.--------         "The big issue everybody is grappling with is…how do you do policy-making in this world when you----         have a crisis upon a crisis and you haven't recovered from the first crisis yet," Gita Gopinath, first----         deputy managing director at the IMF, said in an interview.--------         Nonmilitary support for Ukraine and developing-country debt stress were top topics for finance----         ministers and central bankers attending the meetings.--------         Ukraine's financial needs, according to officials from Kyiv and the multilateral groups, fall into two main----         categories: short term and long term.--------         The country needs roughly $5 billion every month to cover essential government services over the next----         two to three months, according to the IMF's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, referring to a----         budgetary shortfall resulting from a drop in revenue and increased costs such as caring for wounded----         soldiers and displaced citizens.--------         Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the delegates in his video appearance at a World Bank----         roundtable on Ukraine aid Thursday that "the Russian military aims at destroying all objects in Ukraine------------         that can serve as an economic base for life that includes railroad stations, food warehouses, oil----         refineries."--------         Mr. Shmyhal said about $600 billion would be needed for the costs of recovery, reconstruction and----         transformation of its economy. He said his government has asked a number of countries to provide----         10% of their unused special drawing rights—IMF-created monetary-reserve assets—to help Ukraine----         after a $650 billion global allocation last year to boost world liquidity.--------         Meanwhile, the World Bank estimates the physical damage to Ukraine's infrastructure and buildings at----         $60 billion so far.--------         World Bank President David Malpass suggested that reconstruction planning is under way. He said----         during the Thursday roundtable that the rebuilding should start with urgent repairs to essential----         infrastructure such as transportation, power, heating and digital connectivity within six to eight months----         of the end of the war. Efforts to strengthen cities, households, agriculture and businesses should----         follow, he said.--------         "As the war continues, we will work to build confidence in Ukraine's financial, monetary and fiscal----         institutions, " Mr. Malpass said.--------         Officials from multilateral institutions said they hope to provide support for Ukraine's short-term----         budgetary needs with grants from countries, rather than loans that require repayments, given the----         current dysfunction of its economy. The IMF projected this past week that Ukraine's economy would----         shrink 35% this year. Mr. Shmyhal said more than 60% of the country's businesses stopped their----         operations completely or partially in March, including the iron and steel works plant in Mariupol, where----         Ukrainian soldiers have been holed up.--------         Putting together a package for reconstruction will be more complex. To persuade nations to provide----         sizable resources, Ukraine needs to pledge to overhaul its economy while presenting plans to----         strengthen its long-term resilience, including environmental efforts, said Ms. Renaud-Basso of the----         EBRD.--------         "Before the war, Ukraine had a huge agenda of reform in terms of improving governance, fighting----         against corruption and improving its judicial system," she said. "These challenges remain, and they will----         have to be addressed in the reconstruction if there is to be a lot of international support."--------         Bringing in private-sector investments is also essential, officials said. On Thursday, U.S. Deputy----         Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo and Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko invited----         executives from top U.S. financial entities for dinner to discuss how they could help in rebuilding----         Ukraine. Included were Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and----         Mastercard Inc.--------         "We believe that the only way to give us the necessary energy to get out from the crisis is a huge----         amount of investment, private investment," Mr. Marchenko said in an interview with The Wall Street----         Journal.--------         He said the group discussed possible reforms in Ukraine to accommodate greater private investment,----         including fighting corruption, improving the judicial system and bolstering investor protections.--------         "It's wise to do some steps, some necessary steps to be able to attract additional investment into----         Ukraine," Mr. Marchenko said.--------         Predicting the extent of the damage and the cost of reconstruction is difficult as the war continues,----         officials said. Clearly the amounts will be huge.--------         SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS--------         How can the global community prepare for the long-term effects of the war in Ukraine?

All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         The West's window into the Russian economy is closing.--------         In recent days, authorities stopped publishing data on government debt, trade statistics and oil----         production. The central bank limited the volume of financial information that local banks have to publish----         regularly while lawmakers are working on a bill banning lenders from sharing data with foreign states.--------TD----         SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS--------         How effective do you think the sanctions against Russia are? Join the conversation below.--------         The growing blackout is part of an effort by the Russian authorities to protect the economy and----         domestic companies from further sanctions by the West following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.----         Limited data means that Washington and Brussels will have less visibility on whether and how their----         sanctions are biting into the Russian economy, making it more challenging to find new targets and----         fine-tune future sanctions rounds.--------         "They are trying to obscure the economic picture," said Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the----         Institute of International Finance. "We have bans on Russian media and now the same goes for----         statistics access. The Iron Curtain is coming up from both sides."--------         The sanctions have cut off Moscow from much of the Western financial infrastructure. Economists are----         predicting a deep recession, combined with steep inflation. Russian unemployment is rising amid an----         exodus of Western companies.--------         Last week, a branch of the Russian energy ministry that releases monthly oil production and export----         data said it was limiting "the dissemination of information that can be used as additional pressure on the----         Russian market and its participants," according to Russian state newswire TASS.--------         The agency has indefinitely stopped the distribution of monthly crude oil production data as well as data----         on the shipments of fuel oil from Russian refineries and gas-processing plants to domestic and export----         markets, TASS said.--------         Such information from one of the world's top oil producers is crucial at a time of high crude prices.----         Russian President Vladimir Putin recently said that Western sanctions have stymied Russia's energy----         industry. While oil-data watchers have more than one way way of collecting statistics, includingtanker----         tracking and information from traders, the lack of timely official Russia numbers would make it harder to----         monitor global supply.--------         In that way, the data limits help "cloud the picture of the problems the Russian energy industry is----         facing," said Mikhail Krutikhin, a partner at independent consulting firm RusEnergy.--------        The blackout isn't total: The government still publishes mainstay figures such as those for inflation,----        gross domestic product and a host of other data. But the scope of the releases has narrowed.--------         On Tuesday, the central bank suspended the release of the foreign-debt payment schedule, which----         typically lays out the external debt that Russia needs to pay in a schedule based on its maturity. Paying----         foreign debt has become a sensitive issue as Moscow teeters on the brink of a default on its----         international bonds. With a big chunk of its foreign reserves sanctioned, Russia now can't make certain----         payments in dollars. Earlier this month, S&P Global moved Russia into default on its foreign-debt credit----         rating after the government attempted to make a payment on a dollar bond to investors in rubles.--------         A spokesperson for Russia's central bank didn't respond to a request for comment.--------         On Thursday, the country's Federal Customs Service suspended its monthly publication of data on----         exports and imports. The data normally contain thousands of categories of goods and services that----         Russia imports and exports, including items as varied as live sheep, nuclear equipment and vulcanized----         rubber.--------         "I support this decision and consider it justified in order to avoid incorrect estimates, speculations and----         discrepancies in terms of import deliveries," said the head of service Vladimir Bulavin. The central bank----         had earlier also suspended the publication of trade data.--------         Analysts may be able to reconstruct some of the trade impact on Russia by examining data from its top----         trading partners, but it is a laborious process and it could take time for a picture to emerge.--------         On the banking front, local lenders won't be required to publish some financial statements for the period----         from Dec. 31, 2021 to Oct. 1, 2022, the central bank said Tuesday. Banks also don't have to disclose----         capital and risk information during the same period. And on Wednesday, the State Duma, Russia's----         lower house of parliament, approved a draft bill that would ban Russian banks from sharing banking----         secrets with foreign states. That includes data on customers and their transactions as well as about----         beneficiaries and beneficial owners.--------         Restrictions on banking data could conceal a banking crisis. Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and----         European nations were aimed at hobbling Russia's financial system. It cut major Russian banks' access----         to the dollar and other reserve currencies and severed some of the lenders from the Swift----         global-payments messaging system.--------         Last month, the central bank said it would temporarily cut the volume of financial reporting required----         from lenders to "limit credit institutions' risks associated with the sanctions imposed by Western----         countries."--------         The data blackout "can impact the design of sanctions, particularly financial sanctions, if crucial----         information is missing," said Maria Shagina, visiting senior fellow at the Finnish Institute of International----         Affairs.--------         The blackout represents a U-turn for Russia, which built a robust infrastructure for data gathering and----         dissemination following the fall of the Soviet Union. Russia had worked for years to improve its----         creditworthiness with foreign investors and was rated investment grade before the war.--------         While official statistics from other emerging markets often have been criticized by analysts and----         international institutions for their data quality or government influence, Russian data have been widely----         accepted by independent economists.--------         "It used to be: Publish it unless there is a reason to hide it. Now it looks like: Hide it unless there is a----         reason to publish it," said Janis Kluge, an expert on the Russian economy at the German Institute for----         International and Security Affairs. "As long as the data was not too political, the statisticians could----         continue publishing it."--------         One exception was official mortality figures during the pandemic, which revealed a discrepancy----         between lower official Covid-19 deaths and significantly higher excess mortality, or deaths above the----         long-term average. Analysts have accused Russia of undercounting Covid-19 deaths and playing----         downthe pandemic's severity, a charge Russian authorities have denied.--------         Now, the limits imposed on official statistics are much more widespread—and economists expect the----         data restrictions trend to continue.--------         "It's getting more and more challenging and we might get to a point where we'd be inferring from----         satellite photos about what's happening in the Russian economy," Ms. Ribakova said.--------         Write to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com--------         Russia Blocks Economic Data, Hiding Effect of Western Sanctions------------IN       ifosfl : Fossil Fuels | i1 : Energy--------NS       e1118 : Trade Figures | ecat : Economic News | c13 : Regulation/Government Policy | ccat :----         Corporate/Industrial News | e11 : Economic Performance/Indicators | e212 : Government Borrowing |----         e51 : Trade/External Payments | gesanc : International Sanctions | gpir : Politics/International Relations----         | gpol : Domestic Politics | gtrade : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | ncolu : Columns | npred : Economic----         Predictions/Forecasts | gcat : Political/General News | e21 : Government Finance | gdip : International----         Relations | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter----RE       russ : Russia | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia----         Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing----         Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe----IPD      Wires--------IPC      I/FSL--------PUB      Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN       Document WSJO000020220423ei4n000gp------------------------CLM       Europe News----SE        World----HD        Sanctions Strand Thousands of Russia-Bound Luxury Cars; Vehicles stuck at Belgium port as----          customs officials navigate sanctions related to Ukraine invasion----BY        By Costas Paris----WC        945 words----PD        23 April 2022----ET        20:30----SN        The Wall Street Journal Online----SC        WSJO----LA        English----CY        Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----          Some 8,000 luxury cars destined for Russia are parked at the Port of Zeebrugge in Belgium as----          authorities there try to navigate a maze of sanctions slapped on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.--------          The cars—including some of the latest Lexus, Cadillac and Mercedes models—arrived from Asia in----          the first week of April. They were supposed to be transshipped to Russia, but came under a luxury ban----          that prohibits vehicles worth more than €50,000, equivalent to $54,000, from being exported. The----          buildup of vehicles is one example of the confusion at key European ports over how to interpret and----          enforce sanctions against Russia.--------TD----          "The vehicles came under the luxury ban, but there is a range of other products stuck here that come----          under different sanctions," said Marc Adriansens, director of the port's car terminal. "The cars won't----          likely move for a long time as they'll probably be sold to different markets."--------          Mr. Adriansens said he didn't know who the buyers of the cars in Russia are, or who owns them at this----          stage. He said Zeebrugge has space for 10,000 vehicles.--------          Ports across the world, including car terminals, have been struggling to cope with record volumes of----          cargoes as economies open from the Covid-19 pandemic.--------          Zeebrugge is one of Europe's biggest vehicle transshipment ports, moving more than two million cars----          a year. But sanctions apply to a range of products including aircraft parts, machinery, chemicals and----          semiconductors.--------          Zeebrugge port officials said more than 1,000 Russian-destined containers have been blocked for----          checks and that a number of other export hubs around Europe are dealing with similar issues.--------          "There is a lot of confusion, and we need from authorities a list of ships that we should be looking out----          for," said Isabelle Ryckbost, secretary-general of the European Sea Ports Organization, a trade body----          grouping the EU's biggest ports. "Supply chains are already massively disrupted, and delays to check----          which ships and what products are banned adds to the strain."--------          With new sanctions on Russia introduced regularly, European customs officers are struggling to keep----          up, according to people familiar with the matter. A particular problem with sea trade is that although----          Russian-flagged vessels are banned from ports in Europe and the U.S., many are still sailing using----          other flags and are registered outside Russia.--------          ESPO called on EU governments this week to deploy more staff and resources to determine which----          vessels and cargo are covered by the ban and which ones are to be exempted.--------          The EU has issued some guidelines on how to implement the bans, but port operators said the rules----          are often confusing and involve a lot of exemptions.----------------          Russia's oil and gas exports aren't banned, but tanker owners say they are largely staying away from----          lifting crude at the Black and Baltic seas, fearing they will be caught in the sanctions.--------          "We have 4-5 ships with Chevron on time charter, but we can't sail in to pick up the crude because we----          can't get insured," said Nikolas Tsakos, founder and chief executive of New York-listed TEN Ltd., one----          of the world's biggest tanker operators.--------          He said shipowners with long-term contracts that are moving Russian oil and gas are only allowed to----          discharge the cargo at a European port because of the continent's energy shortage.--------          "A lot of tankers have contracts to take cargoes to China and India," Mr. Tsakos said. "But if you do it,----          your ships could be blacklisted. We all support the Russian sanctions, but this is sheer madness."--------          Oil traders and freight forwarders estimate that at least 200 tankers that routinely move Russian oil----          and gas have been idled because they fear they will be sanctioned. But with Russia offering clients----          sharp discounts for its crude, some tankers take the risk and sail into the Black Sea where they mostly----          pick up the oil from other ships.--------          "If you take the risk, your ship will earn more than $200,000 a day for going into the Black Sea----          compared with $30,000 elsewhere," a Singapore oil trader said. "It's happening, and it will happen----          more going forward."--------          The risk goes beyond penalties. A number of commercial ships in the Black Sea have been attacked,----          and the waterway, which is normally used by hundreds of vessels daily to move big shipments of----          grains, oil and LNG, has been heavily mined. Ukraine's ports in the Black Sea have been closed since----          early March.--------          Apart from oil, gas and grains, the ships are also used to import cargoes of steel, copper, aluminum----          and nickel from Russia into Europe. Seaborne EU exports to Russia include technology products,----          paper, fertilizers, home goods and clothing.--------          Europe has already banned Russian coal imports and the next step could be fossil fuels and LNG.----          Although there is still no political consensus with the EU for such sanctions, any move to ban energy----          products would have a profound impact on ports such as Zeebrugge.--------          The port is a main entry, transshipment and storage facility for LNG shipments serving north and----          western European clients.--------          "The cars are a problem, but as long as gas keeps moving, I think Zeebrugge will be OK," Mr.----          Adriansens said. "But if those cargoes from Russia stop, the port will be in trouble."--------          Write to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com--------          Sanctions Strand Thousands of Russia-Bound Luxury Cars--------IN        i763 : Port/Harbor Operations | iaut : Automotive | iship : Water Transport/Shipping | itsp :----          Transportation/Logistics | imarfr : Marine Freight | i74 : Marine Transport | icargo : Freight----          Transport/Logistics----NS        gesanc : International Sanctions | c13 : Regulation/Government Policy | ccat : Corporate/Industrial----          News | e51 : Trade/External Payments | ecat : Economic News | gpir : Politics/International Relations |----          gtrade : Trade Barriers/Restrictions | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News | gdip :----          International Relations | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E Industry News----          Filter----RE        russ : Russia | belg : Belgium | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eecz : European Union Countries |----          eurz : Europe | uk : United Kingdom | ukrn : Ukraine | ussrz : CIS Countries | weurz : Western Europe |----          apacz : Asia Pacific | benluxz : Benelux Countries | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging----          Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe----IPD       Wires--------IPC       CVX--------PUB       Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN        Document WSJO000020220423ei4n001jl------------------------HD       The Ukraine Crisis: Budweiser Brewer Joins Russia Pullout --- AB InBev said it would sell----         joint-venture stake, as other companies weigh their options----BY       By Saabira Chaudhuri and Georgi Kantchev----WC       803 words----PD       23 April 2022----SN       The Wall Street Journal----SC       J----PG       A7----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

That follows moves by its biggest rivals, Heineken NV and Carlsberg----         A/S, which operate independently in Russia, and said weeks ago they would leave.--------TD----         AB InBev operates in Russia through a noncontrolling stake in a joint venture run by Turkish drinks----         maker Anadolu Efes. The Budweiser maker said Friday it was in discussions to sell its stake to Anadolu----         Efes.--------         Carlsberg said Thursday it would take a $1.39 billion write-down tied to its decision to leave Russia.----         Heineken has said it expects to take a $432 million charge tied to its move to pull out.--------         Two months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, companies that haven't already left the country are----         evaluating their continued presence -- based on considerations they say are moral, logistical, or involve----         safety concerns.--------         AB InBev's move comes amid intense pressure on big companies from Ukraine's government, Western----         countries, investors and consumers to pull out of Russia.--------         A raft of financial sanctions and export controls placed on Russia by Washington and its allies has----         made doing routine business in the country difficult, if not impossible, for many companies. Making----         international payments, importing raw materials and paying staff have been complicated by the new----         restrictions.--------         More than 750 Western companies have said they would exit or cut back operations in Russia,----         according to researchers at Yale University.--------         Some companies, such as AB InBev, initially took a more wait-and-see approach. It previously said it----         had asked its Turkish partner to suspend the license for Budweiser in Russia and would forfeit all profits----         from the joint venture.--------         On Friday, it said that request would form part of any agreement between the two companies.--------         Moscow, meanwhile, has been pressuring companies to restart operations.--------         Earlier this week, German auto-parts supplier Continental AG, which in March suspended production at----         its Russia plant, said it temporarily was resuming tire production for passenger cars. It said local----         employees faced the prospect of "severe criminal penalties" if it failed to meet local demand.--------         Representatives for the Russian prosecutor general's office weren't available to comment on such----         penalties. The office previously said it would step up scrutiny of Western companies that have said they----         are pulling out, to ensure enforcement of Russian labor laws.----------------         There are several pieces of legislation that are making their way through the Russian Duma that could----         make it much harder for companies to take a middle path. One measure would allow for the----         nationalization of assets left idle by Western companies. Another is aimed at criminalizing complicity----         with Western sanctions.--------         How either piece of proposed legislation would affect companies is unclear.--------         On Thursday, Russia's deputy trade minister said both IKEA and Zara owner Industria de Diseno Textil----         SA were seeking to reopen their Russian stores after adjusting their supply chains, according to state----         media agency TASS.--------         Viktor Evtukhov said that foreign companies that have suspended their activities cite logistical problems----         rather than the situation in Ukraine, TASS said.--------         Neither IKEA nor Inditex would comment directly about Mr. Evtukhov's statements. An IKEA----         spokeswoman said the company's decision to temporarily pause operations in Russia was still valid.

The Defense Department and State----                    Department declined to comment on Mr. Zelensky's remarks.--------TD----                    "We will talk about the list of weapons we need and the pace of their supply," the Ukrainian----                    president said, adding that he was grateful for recent increases in military shipments.--------                    Mr. Zelensky has pressed Western countries for more weapons and support, and the U.S.----                    and allies have raced to supply Ukraine with NATO-standard heavy weaponry as its----                    outgunned troops seek to repel Russian forces.--------                    Earlier, Mr. Zelensky warned that Russia had its sights set on other European countries if its----                    troops push past Ukrainian forces trying to hold back a renewed Russian offensive in the----                    south and east of the country.--------                    "The Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning, then they want to----                    capture other countries," Mr. Zelensky said in a speech late Friday.--------                    Moscow's gains over the besieged port city of Mariupol likely have begun to free up troops----                    to push further west along Ukraine's southern regions, where Russian troops have made the----                    most progress since the start of its invasionin February.--------                    On Saturday two Russian missiles hit an unspecified military asset and two residential----                    buildings in the coastal city of Odessa, more than 300 miles west of Mariupol, according to a----                    post on the city government's Telegram social-media account. Mr. Zelensky's chief of staff,----                    Andriy Yermak, wrote on his Telegram account that at least five civilians, including an infant,----                    were killed and 18 people wounded. Later, Odessa's Mayor Gennadiy Trukhanov said the----                    number killed was at least eight.--------                    The Russian Ministry of Defense said Russian rockets hit a logistics terminal at a military----                    airfield in the Odessa region.--------                    A Russian general said Friday that Moscow wanted to establish a land corridor from----                    Mariupol to Crimea and onward to the Russian-backed territory of Transnistria, a separatist----                    region established inside neighboring Moldova with Moscow's help, to support Russian----                    speakers there.--------------------                    Moldova on Friday summoned Russia's ambassador over the comments of Maj. Gen.----                    Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia's Central Military District, saying they----                    "are unfounded and contradict the position of the Russian Federation supporting the----                    sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova."--------                    The general's statements, on which the Kremlin declined to comment after they aired on----                    state media, underscored one of Kyiv's central rallying cries for Western support in its fight----                    against Russia: that a revisionist Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, is trying to----                    re-establish a Soviet-era sphere of influence that reaches deep inside Europe.--------                    It also highlighted how the Kremlin has sought to use the so-called separatist republics it----                    has backed across the Caucasus region and Eastern Europe as a pretext to exert control----                    beyond Russia's borders.--------                    Transnistria broke away from former Soviet Republic Moldova following its declaration of----                    independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 in an effort to stay within the Soviet bloc. The----                    Soviet 14th Guards Army intervened months later on the side of the separatists and have----                    stayed in the separatist region as what Moscow calls a peacekeeping force.--------------------                    Police officers climbed into a burned apartment after a Russian rocket attack in Kharkiv,----                    Ukraine, on Friday.

But Ukraine retains control of----                    the port cities of Odessa, near the border with Moldova, and Mykolaiv, where it is working to----                    push back Russian troops. An unknown number of Ukrainian forces also remain in the----                    tunnels and underground bunkers of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol.--------                    Russian strongholds in the south and east have come into renewed focus in recent weeks----                    following Moscow's withdrawal of troops from around Kyiv after a failed attempt to take the----                    capital.--------                    Ukraine's general staff said Saturday that Russian forces have made a tactical push from----                    the Russian-controlled separatist areas in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions to----                    position themselves for an assault on Slovyansk. That city was a center of civilian----                    disappearances and torture at the hands of Russian-backed troops later pushed out by----                    Ukraine during the 2014 conflict in the region.--------                    "In the Donetsk direction, the Russian enemy is conducting offensive operations along the----                    entire line of contact," Ukraine's general staff said Saturday. It said Russia's 64th Separate----                    Motorized Rifle Guards Brigade, which Kyiv says was responsible for some of the worst----                    atrocities against Ukrainians in the city of Bucha, had now taken positions in eastern----                    Ukraine but had suffered heavy losses.--------                    Those battles don't so far amount to the concerted Russian offensive that Ukraine and----                    Western countries expected in what Moscow has called the second phase of the war,----                    according to military analysts. The U.K. Defense Ministry said Saturday that Russia had----                    made no major gains in the previous 24 hours.--------                    Russia's Ministry of Defense said Saturday its forces had used high-precision air-based----                    missiles to strike 25 Ukrainian armored vehicles and three weapons depots overnight. It also----                    said it had shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft in the region of Kharkiv and destroyed 15----                    Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles.--------                    With the battle for Donbas pitting conventional forces against each other, Ukraine is----                    struggling to make up for its disadvantage in artillery and a shortage of Soviet-standard----                    ammunition—one reason Mr. Zelensky has asked the U.S. and allies to supply--------                    NATO-standard heavy weapons. Analysts say it will take weeks for Kyiv to train its forces on----                    the Western systems and use them to full effect.--------                    Ukraine's military has been able to partly offset Russia's overwhelming advantage in aircraft----                    by using Western-supplied antiaircraft missiles, such as Stingers and Starstreaks, to down----                    several Russian jet fighters, helicopters and drones in recent days, according to footage of----                    wreckage posted by Ukrainian troops and verified by military analysts. Ukraine said Friday it----                    lost an An-26B transport plane that hit a power line in the Zaporizhzhia region, leaving at----                    least one crew member dead.--------                    The U.S. has been the first to provide Ukraine with NATO-standard 155-mm howitzers.----                    President Biden said Thursday that Washington's latest $800 million military-aid package----                    would include 72 of the towed artillery pieces in addition to 18 pledged the previous week.--------                    On Friday, Canada said its military had also sent an unspecified number of 155-mm----                    howitzers and antiarmor ammunition to Ukraine. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., citing a----                    military source, reported the package would include GPS-guided Excalibur rounds, which----                    are valued at about $112,000 per round.--------                    French President Emmanuel Macron said Paris was providing Ukraine with Caesar----                    self-propelled 155-mm artillery pieces, in an interview published Friday by the newspaper----                    Ouest-France. The newspaper, citing military sources, reported that Paris was transferring----                    12 Caesars, which have a range of some 40 kilometers, equivalent to about 25 miles, and----                    that Ukrainian soldiers would begin training Saturday in France.--------                    Mauro Orru contributed to this article.--------                    Write to Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com and Yuliya Chernova at----                    yuliya.chernova@wsj.com--------                    U.S. Secretary of State Blinken, Defense Secretary Austin to Visit Ukraine, Zelensky Says--------CO                  usdod : United States Department of Defense--------IN                  iaer : Aerospace/Defense | iindstrls : Industrial Goods--------NS                  gvio : Military Action | gweap : Weapons Programs | gvdef : Defense Department | gcat :----                    Political/General News | gvexe : Executive Branch | gdef : Armed Forces | gdip :----                    International Relations | gpir : Politics/International Relations | ncolu : Columns | nimage :----                    Images | gcns : National/Public Security | gpol : Domestic Politics | grisk : Risk News | gvbod----                    : Government Bodies | ncat : Content Types----RE                  ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | easiaz : Eastern Asia | eurz : Europe | namz : North America |----                    russ : Russia | uk : United Kingdom | usa : United States | ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz :----                    Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz :----                    Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | weurz : Western Europe----IPD                 WSJ--------IPC                 CBD.YY--------PUB                 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN                  Document WSJO000020220423ei4n000b5------------------------CLM      World News----SE       World----HD       Ukraine Accuses Russia of Digging Mass Graves for Civilian Victims; Senior Russian military----         official says Moscow's territorial goals extend beyond the Donbas, toward Moldova's----         Transnistria region----BY       By Yaroslav Trofimov----WC       1,483 words----PD       23 April 2022----ET       11:21----SN       The Wall Street Journal Online----SC       WSJO----LA       English----CY       Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.--------LP----         KHARKIV, Ukraine—Ukrainian officials accused Russia of burying thousands of civilians in mass----         graves outside Mariupol, a city now mostly under Russian control, as a senior Russian military official----         said Moscow's territorial goals extend well beyond Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.--------         Moscow stopped considering Donbas as part of Ukraine—including areas controlled by Kyiv—when----         President Vladimir Putin in February recognized the independence of the so-called Donetsk and----         Luhansk people's republics, statelets created with Moscow's help in part of the region in 2014.--------TD----         Maj. Gen. Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia's Central Military District, said in remarks----         at a conference carried by state media on Friday that Moscow sought to control all of southern Ukraine----         to secure a land corridor to Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014, and to----         Moldova's Transnistria region, where he said Russian speakers suffer from discrimination.--------         To achieve these goals, Russia, in addition to capturing the parts of Donbas that remain under----         Ukrainian control, would also have to seize the coastal regions of Mykolaiv and Odessa. Russian----         forces came close to overrunning Mykolaiv in early March, but since have been repelled and control a----         sliver of the region.--------         Moscow, however, occupies most of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine and a large part of the----         Zaporizhzhia region. Russia's RIA state news agency Friday ran interviews with a member of the----         Russian parliament, Dmitriy Belik, and a pro-Moscow Crimean Tatar leader, Eyvaz Umerov, calling for----         absorbing these occupied territories into a new Crimean federal district within Russia.--------         Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the possibility of Russia expanding its----         military aims in southern Ukraine. It wasn't clear to what extent Gen. Minnekayev's remarks—which----         also included the false claims that Russia fought "against the entire world" in World War II and that----         Russian armed forces are suffering no casualties in Ukraine—reflected the Kremlin's policy.--------         In Mariupol—much of which has been leveled by shelling, bombing and street fights—Ukrainian----         municipal authorities said mass graves for residents killed by the Russian army were being dug outside----         the city in an area that is already twice as large as the local cemetery.--------         "The worst war crime of the 21st century has been committed in Mariupol," Mayor Vadym Boychenko----         said in remarks posted by the municipality on social media. "Putin is exterminating Ukrainians. He has----         already killed tens of thousands of civilians in Mariupol."--------         Satellite images released Thursday by Maxar Technologies showed what appeared to be more than----         200 mass graves in the town of Manhush, just outside Mariupol. These graves could contain between----         3,000 and 9,000 people, the municipality said. Russia didn't immediately respond to a request for----         comment. In general it ascribes all civilian casualties in Mariupol to Ukrainian forces.----------------         Russia on Thursday announced a victory in the strategic port city even though Ukrainian forces were----         still blockaded inside its vast Azovstal steel plant. A spokesman for Ukrainian President Volodymyr----         Zelensky said while nearly all of Mariupol was under Russian control, the fight for the plant continued.--------         A rare acknowledgment of Moscow's deliberate strategy to level Mariupol, which used to be home to----         about 400,000 people, came from a Thursday address by Adam Delimkhanov, a Russian lawmaker----         from Chechnya who led Chechen units of the Russian National Guard in battles for the city.--------         "We can say that the special operation to destroy and cleanse Mariupol has now been concluded," Mr.----         Delimkhanov said alongside a unit of Chechen Russian National Guard troops in front of a burning----         Mariupol building. The troops in the video chanted, "Russia is strength" and "Allahu akbar."--------         Mr. Peskov said Russian troops had sealed off the Azovstal steel plant, where an estimated 1,500----         Ukrainian troops were holed up. Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol said they would be ready to withdraw----         with their arms if their safety were guaranteed by a third party.--------         British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday said he agreed with a Western intelligence assessment----         that the war in Ukraine could continue until the end of next year and that Russia could win.--------         "I think the sad thing is it is a realistic possibility," Mr. Johnson said. "Putin has a huge army, he has a----         very difficult position because he's made a catastrophic blunder—the only option he has now is to----         continue to try to use his appalling, grinding approach."--------         The British government also said it would reopen its embassy in Kyiv next week, joining a host of----         nations returning to the Ukrainian capital after Russian forces pulled back from Kyiv and other cities in----         the north. And Mr. Johnson said the government proposes sending tanks to Poland.--------         The U.S. doesn't have diplomatic personnel in Ukraine and hasn't outlined any plans for American----         diplomats to return.--------         As part of an effort to pursue an end to the war, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres----         will travel to Moscow and meet with Mr. Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday----         and will travel to Ukraine and meet with Mr. Zelensky and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba----         on Thursday, according to Mr. Guterres's office.--------         Mr. Putin ordered Russian forces to focus on seizing the parts of Donbas that remain under Ukrainian----         control, after his initial plan to swiftly conquer the capital, Kyiv, and other major cities of eastern and----         central Ukraine failed because of fierce resistance. Russia's new strategy, Ukrainian and Western----         officials say, is to encircle Ukraine's best forces in Donbas through a pincer movement, with offensives----         pushing north from the Zaporizhzhia region and south from the town of Izyum.--------         So far, Russian forces have made incremental gains, taking a handful of small villages since seizing----         the town of Kreminna last weekend. Russian forces on Friday pushed toward Slovyansk, one of the----         main cities in Ukrainian-controlled Donbas, and took over the village of Lozove, according to Ukraine's----         general staff.--------         Ukraine's military has been able to curtail Russia's overwhelming advantage in aircraft by using----         Western-supplied antiaircraft missiles, such as Stinger and Starstreak, to down several Russian jet----         fighters, helicopters and drones in recent days, according to footage of wreckage posted by Ukrainian----         troops and verified by military analysts. Ukraine said Friday it lost an An-26B transport plane that hit a----         power line in the Zaporizhzhia region, leaving at least one crew member dead.--------         With the battle for Donbas pitting conventional forces against each other, Ukraine is struggling to make----         up for its disadvantage in artillery and its shortage of Soviet-standard ammunition—one reason why----         Mr. Zelensky has repeatedly asked the U.S. and allies to supply NATO-standard heavy weapons.--------         The U.S. has been the first to provide Ukraine with NATO-standard 155-mm howitzers. President----         Biden said Thursday that Washington's latest $800 million military-aid package would include 72 of----         these towed artillery pieces in addition to 18 pledged the previous week.--------         On Friday, Canada said its military also sent an unspecified number of 155-mm howitzers and----         anti-armor ammunition to Ukraine. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., citing a military source, reported the----         package would include GPS-guided Excalibur rounds, which are valued at about $112,000 per round.--------         In an interview published Friday by newspaper Ouest-France, French President Emmanuel Macron----         said Paris is providing Ukraine with Caesar self-propelled 155-mm artillery pieces. The newspaper,----         citing military sources, reported that Paris was transferring 12 Caesars, which have a range of some----------------           40 kilometers, equivalent to about 25 miles, and that Ukrainian soldiers would begin training Saturday----           in France.--------           Ukrainian officials have warned recently that Moscow plans in the coming weeks to conduct a sham----           referendum on severing Russian-controlled parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson from Ukraine and----           possibly proclaiming a so-called Kherson people's republic, similar to what it did in Crimea, Donetsk----           and Luhansk in 2014. That would allow Russia to start forcibly drafting local men, as has happened----           with the mandatory mobilization of men up to 65 years old in Donetsk and Luhansk.--------           Russia already has replaced most mayors in occupied areas of southern Ukraine with handpicked----           allies, with the exception of the mayor of the city of Kherson. Moscow hasn't commented publicly on----           referendum plans. "Not a single person in the Kherson region, which awaits liberation, will come to that----           referendum," the Ukrainian governor of Kherson, Hennadiy Lahuta, said in a TV appearance.----           "Anything they may conduct will be unlawful and falsified."--------           Georgi Kantchev contributed to this article.--------           Write to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com--------           Ukraine Accuses Russia of Digging Mass Graves for Civilian Victims--------NS         gvexe : Executive Branch | gvio : Military Action | gdef : Armed Forces | gpir : Politics/International----           Relations | gvbod : Government Bodies | ncolu : Columns | gcat : Political/General News | gcns :----           National/Public Security | gpol : Domestic Politics | grisk : Risk News | ncat : Content Types----RE         russ : Russia | ukrn : Ukraine | asiaz : Asia | crimea : Crimea | donsk : Donbas | easiaz : Eastern Asia |----           eurz : Europe | meastz : Middle East | moldv : Moldova | mscity : Moscow City | uk : United Kingdom |----           ussrz : CIS Countries | apacz : Asia Pacific | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market----           Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | eeurz : Central/Eastern Europe | rucfd : Central Federal----           District | wasiaz : Western Asia | weurz : Western Europe----IPD        WSJ--------IPC        CBD.YY--------PUB        Dow Jones & Company, Inc.--------AN         Document WSJO000020220422ei4m0012x--------Search Summary--------Text                       hd=ukraine or hd=russia----Date                       In the last month----Source                     The Wall Street Journal - All sources Or Barron's - All sources----Author                     All Authors----Company                    All Companies----Subject                    All Subjects----Industry                   All Industries----Region                     All Regions----Language                   English----Results Found              701----Timestamp                  29 April 2022 9:36--------------------
